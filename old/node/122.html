    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Recently I talked with Alex to ask him if he could be interested in making his<br />
SIOC Browser interacting with Talk Digger. In fact, the next version of Talk<br />
Digger, currently in alpha testing, will generate a SIOC document for each<br />
conversation page.</p>
<p>Currently Alex&#8217;s SIOC explorer is crawling and indexing some blogs that<br />
has the<br />
Wordpress (b2Evolution too?) SIOC exporter plugin.</p>
<p>What I suggested him was to let his browser crawl Talk Digger&#8217;s SIOC data<br />
as<br />
well.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Uldis received the acceptance of his speech at the<br />
BlogTalk Reloaded conference. Their job (because he is not alone in the boat)<br />
is to merge all the current SIOC browsers into a unique one for the<br />
presentation (at least it is what I understood).</p>
<p>As people know, the idea behind the SIOC ontology is to link online communities<br />
together. So the idea is the present information, in the same environment (a<br />
SIOC browser in the present case), from many different sources/types of<br />
communities.</p>
<p>So what I would suggest is to start thinking about a way to let Talk Digger<br />
ping the SIOC browser when new SIOC data is available from Talk Digger for the<br />
browser.</p>
<p>By example: a new conversation is tracked by Talk Digger. Once it is tracked,<br />
Talk Digger would ping the SIOC browser to let him know that at the URL<br />
&#8220;X&#8221;<br />
there are new SIOC data ready to be crawled. Then the SIOC crawler would crawl<br />
the URL, index the results, and present it into the browser, along with the<br />
other sources of information (blog, forums, IRC chat logs, etc).</p>
<p>At first, I could create a list of links where data could be crawled, and later<br />
we could think about a more automatic/permanent way to let them interact<br />
together. At first I thought about a simple pinging system using XML-RPC (like<br />
all the new search engines pinging systems). But any other methods could work<br />
as well.</p>
<p>So let me know if you could be interested, if it is a good idea, and how/when<br />
it could be done.</p>
<p>Salutations,</p>

<p>Actually, the browser is just a front-end to any SPARQL store.<br />
What I've done with it is:<br />
- Use Uldis crawler to get SIOC content from different sources;<br />
- Put all the data in a RDF stote;<br />
- Put the browser as a frontend of the store</p>

<p>Indeed, we should get a way to link between the plaform(s) that will<br />
crawl / store SIOC data and the ones that create some, so that stores<br />
will be up-to-date.</p>

<p>An RDF file containing recently created links could be good to start:<br />
a cron could fetch it and get only new URLs using incremental crawler,<br />
then we'll put data it in the store.<br />
A ping service will be nicer, but longer to implement I think, so we<br />
can start with this list.</p>

<p>Let's start with it :)<br />
What you could do first is to create this URLs page, so we can try the<br />
crawler and its incremental functions on it to see if we fetch the<br />
data as aspected.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, we'll work on the browser with Uldis, so we can<br />
think on specific queries for TalkDigger.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Alex.</p>

<p>Great perfect, it is what I thought.</p>
<p>What is the file format you would like to use? A single list of urls in a text<br />
files separeted by carriage-return? :)</p>
<p>Or in XML, or RDF, or... tell me tell me! :)</p>
<p>> In the meanwhile, we'll work on the browser with Uldis, so we can<br />

<p>It is perfect for me. I could give you the list tomorrow without any problem,<br />
so you could start to crawl it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But before, I have to know: the crawler is understanding which version of the<br />
Ontology? Right now I am using the last "stable" one (the one without the<br />
recent modifications).</p>
<p>Keep me in touch.</p>

I think that an RDF file that defines new URLs with seeAlso property<br />
is the best way to do. So that the script will fetch this file, go<br />
throught the seeAlso links, and get the files only if they're new.<br />
One problem is that the file will become bigger every day, so we must<br />
find a way to get not too much already-fetched URLs in it. This issue<br />
will be solved with a ping system, but at the moment, maybe your file<br />
can show only URLs created during the last 5 days. I'll try to make<br />
the cron run daily.</p>

Humm ... I think it works with the stable one at the moment, i.e. the<br />
one used in PHP API.<br />
Anyway, I'll have a look at TalkDigger SIOC data to see if it fits<br />
with the current browser.</p>
<p>BTW, TD data will be in the same store than other blogs, maybe it can<br />
lead to interesting queries :)</p>

<p>I have no problem with that. However what I am thinking to do is creating a<br />
test file with a couple of hundred of URLs to test it with your crawler. If it<br />
works fine, I will generate a list of the thousands of Conversations I am<br />
currently tracking and send the file via email. And if everything works fine,<br />
we will then be able create an online list with the conversations that changed<br />
in the last 5 days for example.</p>
<p>What do you think of this plan?</p>
<p>Also, do you know when the new ontology will be supported by the crawler?<br />
Because I was planning to change it in the next days/weeks.</p>
<p>> BTW, TD data will be in the same store than other blogs, maybe it can<br />

<p>It is exactly what I hope :)</p>
<p>Take care,</p>

Actually, the data will be in the store anyway, we'll just have to<br />
make queries that will take the new, rather than the older, ontology<br />
into account.<br />
But I think we'll also update the API, and the exporters, to the latest version.</p>
<p>Are you using Community in your SIOC data ? At the moment, the data in<br />
the store mainly consists of Posts, so we'll be able to write new<br />

<p>Nah, not at the moment. I'll have to take a day in the next week to re<br />
-implement it with the new specs.</p>
<p>So tell me when you would like to have the links: before or after my<br />

<p>Maybe a look at the scutter vocabulary at http://rdfweb.org/topic/<br />
ScutterVocab could be helpful. ldodd's slug uses it to keep track of<br />
what the scutter/crawler fetched and what the return caode etc. was.<br />
This gives a map of what may be valuable to fech again or not (maybe<br />
many not-modified responses from one domain).</p>

<p>While using latest version of SIOC crawler, I noticed it also got a<br />
RDF vocab to store fetched files properties (Errors, ...), which is<br />
indeed, is useful, eg: I parsed it to put in the store only data that<br />
have been fetched correctly.</p>
<p>Maybe these 2 vocabs could be merged ?</p>

      <p>hmm. I mentioned scutter vocab to Uldis earlier... he thought it is<br />
overblown... I think: go with the flow/majority :)<br />
Using the same scutter vocab as others may enable switching from one<br />
crawler software to another... I use slug for my crawling...</p>
