    <p>Hi, All !</p>
<p>Below is information about proposed changes to the SIOC ontology. John<br />
Breslin and me have made a summary of them which I am posting here to<br />
collect your feedback.</p>
<p>General info about SIOC: http://rdfs.org/sioc/</p>
<p>The actual changes to RDFS/OWL "code" can be seen as the difference<br />
between current ontology [1] and the version with proposed changes<br />
implemented [2]. A part of these changes have been discussed on<br />
SIOC-Dev and RDF-Web mailing lists before.</p>
<p>In particular we will be grateful if those of you who have experience<br />
in designing and improving the FOAF ontology would help improve SIOC.</p>
<p>[1] http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns<br />
[2] http://sw.deri.org/svn/sw/2005/08/sioc/ns/sioc<br />
A detailed list of changes:<br />
http://sw.deri.org/svn/sw/2005/08/sioc/ns/CHANGES</p>
<p>=1= Use foaf:Person instead of sioc:User for person's data</p>
<p>Name, surname and other personal data will be described via a<br />
foaf:Person, which will point to the sioc:User (person's account on the<br />
community site) using foaf:holdsAccount property.</p>
<p>Actions:<br />
 - deprecate sioc:first_name and sioc:last_name<br />
Open questions:<br />
 - how to keep the information that this _particular_ account is<br />
associated with a given e-mail address (or hash of it)? we might also<br />
deprecate foaf:email and foaf:email_sha1 and use FOAF properties, but<br />
shall we not worry that when person's data are smushed together we<br />
loose a link between OnlineAccount and an e-mail address?<br />
 - same can be true of name (e.g., if the person has a different name<br />
specified for each site)</p>
<p>=2= Changes to properties representing plain/rich content</p>
<p>sioc:content is redundant - SIOC has sioc:description (subclass of<br />
dc:description) using which is more consistent.<br />
sioc:content_encoded - there is already content:encoded module for RSS<br />
1.0 that can be used to describe encoded content (e.g., HTML). let's<br />
leave it out of SIOC ontology for now as encoding and describing rich<br />
content can be a complex task.</p>
<p>Actions:<br />
 - deprecate sioc:content (use sioc:description instead) and<br />
sioc:content_encoded (use content:encoded instead)<br />
 - change rdfs:comment for sioc:description accordingly (TODO)</p>
<p>=3= Cleanup</p>
<p>Remove:<br />
- commented out events related properties (starts_at, finished_at,<br />
event) - events are outside scope<br />
- sioc:is_category and sioc:is_closed<br />
- sioc:location</p>
<p>Change property name / fix description:<br />
 - sioc:has_revisor to :has_modifier (modification better describes<br />
changing the Post)<br />
 - sioc:reference to :links_to (reference has vague meaning, also does<br />
not fit out naming convention)<br />
 - sioc:revisor_of to :modifier_of</p>
<p>Change range:<br />
 - sioc:type - range to rdfs:Resource</p>
<p>=4= Change roles / permissions properties</p>
<p>Change description and domain/range:<br />
 - sioc:function_of - range to sioc:user (removes Usergroup from its<br />
range)<br />
 - sioc:has_scope - range to sioc:Forum<br />
 - sioc:scope_of - range to Resource</p>
<p>=5= Changes to subject, topic, title</p>
<p>Separate subject information into:<br />
 - text (e.g., keywords) described by sioc:subject<br />
 - resources (e.g., SKOS concepts) described by sioc:topic</p>
<p>Actions:<br />
 - change description of sioc:subject + remove domain of sioc:Post +<br />
subclass from dc:subject<br />
 - change description of sioc:topic + change range to rdfs:Resource<br />
 - add sioc:title property (take former description of sioc:subject) +<br />
subclass from dc:title</p>
<p>=6= Names, IDs</p>
<p>add sioc:id - a new property to represent the ID of the SIOC object<br />
(e.g., user ID, post ID, ...)<br />
change description of sioc:name to use it to represent user / account<br />
names for sioc:User(s) and sioc:Usergroup(s)</p>
<p>=Open Questions=</p>
<p>-?- Shall we subclass sioc:created_at and sioc:modified_at from dc:date<br />
or dc_terms:issued and dc_terms:modified ?</p>
<p>-?- Shall we subclass sioc:link (used to describe link to a web page<br />
about the SIOC object - Post, User, ...) from dc:identifier ?</p>
<p>-?- Shall we change the way we represent modifications / different<br />
versions of the data? Currently we have rather simple next_version,<br />
previous_version and has_modifier, modifier_of. Another option is to<br />
introduce "modification events" that we can add more information to [at<br />
a cost of the complexity of data/ontology]</p>
<p>CHANGES file has slightly more details, though I've covered 95% of them<br />
in this post.</p>
<p>Note to developers: some of the proposed changes will have impact on<br />
the SIOC export tools. Please come to the SIOC-Dev mailing list,<br />
discuss and ask for more information if needed.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />

      <p>Hi all -</p>
<p>Just some details of proposed ontology changes as commented on by Alex<br />
below.  I'll put in my 2c.</p>
<p> > ** Ontology<br />
 ><br />

<p>Sounds fine!</p>
<p> > - User: sioc:knows => moved to FOAF property<br />

login<br />

<p>This is semantically more correct because it's not the User that knows<br />
people or has a name, it's the associated foaf:Person.</p>
<p> > sioc:avatar => shall we use FOAF foaf:depiction or is the avatar<br />
local for<br />
 > the forum ?</p>
<p>Yeah the avatar would be local to a forum, but maybe it is too Bulletin<br />
Board specific as pointed out by Richard?  But also this could be a<br />
Gravatar as used in the blogosphere, and that is associated with an<br />
e-mail address...</p>
<p> > - sioc:link => isn't rdf:about enough to get the URL from a Post ?</p>
<p>I don't think so - because some Posts will not have specific URLs and<br />
their rdf:about would be the same - take comments on WordPress for<br />
example - there's a #comment that links to all the comments but no URLs<br />
for each comment "Post".</p>
<p> > - sioc:related_to => The specs say "determined implicity from topics or<br />

<p>Maybe the spec needs to be changed to say that is one possibility.  I am<br />
thinking of bulletin board systems that show you potentially related<br />
posts, e.g. look at the end of<br />
http://www.boards.us/forums/showthread.php?t=2124 or the similar posts<br />
thing in WordPress.</p>
<p> > - sioc:has_sibling / sioc:sibling_of => If I understood well, I think<br />

relation.</p>
<p>Yep!  Can drop the has_/_of even and just say sibling?</p>
<p> > - sioc:type => removed [1]<br />
 ><br />

<p>I have a similar problem.  I want to define a subscriber to a forum.<br />
But it's a bit "wordy" - to find all subscribers to a forum I need to<br />
find all Users with Roles applying to Forums where the Role is of type<br />
#moderator or something.</p>
<p>The Role idea seemed like a good idea because you wouldn't have to<br />
define a million properties.  I think this could be a good idea for the<br />
modules or types file.  This types file could have:</p>
<p>Forum: Blog, Mailing_List, USENET_Newsgroup, Bulletin_Board, ...<br />
Role: Owner, Administrator, Moderator, Subscriber, Registered_User,</p>
<p>I think Uldis thought of having instances rather than classes for these<br />
types.</p>
<p> > Regarding the version properties, what about moving it into a<br />

<p>Yes, and also our thought too - we removed all these "extra" stuff that<br />
we now want to put into a "types" module.</p>
<p> > Regarding trackback, I think we should subclass it from has_reply /<br />

<p>If a reply is more general than a trackback - sounds fine.  I guess all<br />
trackbacks are distributed replies, but all distributed replies are not<br />
trackbacks...</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Thanks a lot to all who commented!<br />
Here's my 2c and some ontology changes.</p>

<p>Done - properties used in current exporters changed to<br />
owl:DeprecatedProperty (and won't show up in the spec), sioc:knows,<br />
sioc:sibling_of and sioc:type removed altogether.</p>
<p>Property sioc:has_sibling changed to owl:SymmetricProperty. It's name<br />
does not imply any particular direction so it is be good to stay.</p>
<p>A question related to content / content_encoded properties - what<br />
property shall we use instead of sioc:content? potential candidates are<br />
sioc:description or dc:description.</p>
<p>>  > BTW, do we keep sioc:name ? or do we move to a new sioc:accountName /<br />
> login property ?</p>
<p>Using foaf:accountName to indicate the username of the account is a<br />
possibility. Do we loose some semantics of sioc:name if we do so?</p>
<p>Just one thing - description of sioc:name says "The name of a User or a<br />
Usergroup". What will we use to indicate the name of the group? (And do<br />
Usergroups have account names at all?)</p>

<p>Avatar is something specific to an account - quite often they have no<br />
resemblance of the person in real life (which a depiction would<br />
suggest). Gravatars should not require a special property as they are<br />
associated with foaf:mbox.</p>
<p>Suggest that we keep sioc:avatar for now - since we are trying to make<br />
SIOC generic enough so it can describe all these different kinds of<br />
community sites it would make sense to keep avatar if it is required<br />
for, say, bulleting boards.</p>
<p>BTW - when saying this - it would be good to have SIOC export from a<br />
bulleting board (vBulletin, others). Then we would better see what is<br />
needed and what is not.</p>

<p>Agree to the next post by Richard: in WordPress the comments do have a<br />
URIs though they do not have a page of their own.</p>
<p>In most of the cases rdf:about should be enough.</p>
<p>The idea behind sioc:link is to point to a human-readable<br />
representation / original page containing this SIOC object. If dropping<br />
sioc:link and assume that we want the user to be able to get to the<br />
original post (e.g., to comment), there are 2 open questions:<br />
1) will rdf:about always point to the original post (=can it be used to<br />
get to the post/comment/...)?<br />
2) how will we get to the original location for that small number of<br />
SIOC objects who do not have a URI of their own? (imagine if WP did not<br />
have fragment identifiers for comments).</p>
<p>How shall we answer these questions and shall we keep or delete<br />
sioc:link?</p>

<p>Please suggest changes if needed.</p>
<p>Part of the relations can be inferred from the topic / subject / ...<br />
But even in this case it may be worthwhile to keep this inferred result<br />
in the knowledge base. Besides, there can be other relations (e.g.,<br />
explicitly said by the user) that can not be inferred.</p>
<p>We are not using sioc:related_to much now, but it sounded interesting<br />
enough to put into the ontology. It acts as a "loose" relation property<br />
(similar foaf:knows in FOAF) - it may be useful for keeping different<br />
type of relations, but at the same time if you want to keep more<br />
specific information, you may want to subclass it or create a new<br />
property (e.g., sioc:links_to).</p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>
<p>And thanks again to everybody for the input into developing SIOC! :)<br />
With this speed of community effort it's even hard to keep up with the<br />
pace.</p>
<p>Best,<br />

<p>That would be good practice for sioc:Post, because everything you say<br />
about a sioc:Post is really about the web page where you can see the<br />

the existing URL.</p>

<p>Well, if it doesn't have a URL, then linking to the original location<br />

<p>To clarify the question - it is the situation when there is a page<br />
(identified with a URL) that has a number of SIOC objects (e.g.,<br />
comments) which do not have URLs of their own.</p>
<p>In such case you can't address them individually, yet you can point to<br />
a web page where these items are located. Using it as rdf:about would<br />
be wrong.</p>
<p>> I also don't think it happens much. The vast majority of community<br />

<p>Agree. It should not happen often.</p>
<p>> That being said, sioc:content (or its replacement in the new version)<br />
> could be used to include the content directly.</p>
<p>Including content is not a problem - we are already doing it. The<br />
problem is how to provide a link to the original, human readable page -<br />
for example, to let reader respond to a comment (or to verify that the<br />
page actually says what he sees in SIOC data).</p>
<p>Maybe there is a Dublin Core property that we can use.<br />
(Update: no need any more, foaf:page mentioned below should do it)</p>
<p>When talking about responding to comments - maybe we need a property<br />
(re-use existing or add to SIOC) to show where the reader can respond /<br />
provide feedback?</p>

<p>foaf:page looks like what is needed.<br />

<p>That's a good point, you can still point to a page containing the<br />
items in question.</p>
<p>As you said, it doesn't look like a common case and re-using<br />
foaf:page should be fine.</p>

<p>The reply form is usually easily found on the post's web page. I<br />
think a new property wouldn't add a lot of value.</p>

<p>We could use sioc:description and map dc:description. I think the question is:<br />
how do we want people using SIOC: only with its terms or in conjunction with<br />
other ontologies like DC and FOAF? You already make the choice vis-a-vis the<br />
FOAF ontology, but what is the "granularity" you need/wish to have? Where do we<br />
draw the line?</p>

<p>It's good for now, but I think it would be a good idea to rely all the user's<br />
personal information to FAOF. However, it makes sense to leave the sioc:avatar<br />
as-is because it represent the avatar of a user-account and not an individual<br />
(so I can have an avatar related to one of my user-account, and another one that<br />
really depict myself (for example, an avatar for a service account for my job,<br />
another one for my blog, etc)).</p>

<p>I think it is a good idea to keep the sioc:link as-is with the definition you<br />
just provided.</p>
<p>I could take a simple example to explain why. Right now, as you probably know, I<br />
implemented SIOC in Talk Digger. For now, the resources described (about=) are<br />
real web page publicly accessable. However, it is possible that in the future I<br />
need to change some things in the architecture of the system and change some<br />
paths. In that case, I would have to change the URI of the resource I am<br />
describing. But what happen if a triple store somewhere else in the World was<br />
crawling/using my data? He will lose the reference to the resources and will not<br />
be able to relate anything to what he have in store.</p>
<p>By using sioc:link, I will be able to continue to describe my resources using my<br />
old URI naming system, and I will be able to "link" to the "accessible-<br />
resources".</p>
<p>Does it make sense?</p>

<p>Right. That's what we call a "dead link" ;-)</p>

<p>Yes, the problem is real, but I would approach it differently. There<br />
are two possible answers:</p>
<p>First: You changed all your URLs and people have referenced the old<br />
URLs? So what? Stuff breaks on the web, people get 404s, there are<br />
dead links, that's just the way it works. Everybody is used to it and<br />
will work around it. sioc:link wouldn't really fix that problem -- it<br />
only means now there are *two* URIs per post that can break instead<br />
of one. If you can't keep your links stable, then how can we expect<br />
you to keep your resource identifiers stable?</p>
<p>Second: Cool URIs don't change. You should have taken the time to<br />
develop a stable URI scheme before you started. There's things like<br />
mod_rewrite that help. And if you really have to change URIs, put<br />
HTTP redirects in place and nobody will notice. So you can avoid the<br />
broken link problem yourself by doing a little bit of extra<br />
investment. Don't expect sioc:link to fix a basic property of the web<br />
for you ;-)</p>
<p>Sorry if I'm sounding a bit smug here -- I'm obviously talking from a<br />
theorist's perspective here, and I know that things are rarely that<br />
simple when you build real-world stuff. I just want to say that<br />
changing URLs *are* a problem on the web and always were and always<br />
will be, and SIOC won't fix that.</p>

<p>Ask that question to three RDF folks and you will get four different<br />
answers. Here's mine: Yes, non-URL schemes like URNs and the tag:<br />
scheme are more stable than HTTP URIs. But more beautiful? No. I<br />
think the real beauty of URIs is that you can actually retrieve a<br />
representation of the resource that the URI identifies. That's the<br />
really important function of a URI. And you lose that with the urn:<br />
and tag: schemes.</p>
<p>> If so, the sioc:link proproty would be more than essential in such<br />
> a case, no?</p>
<p>You are right, it's possible to get the best of two worlds with<br />
sioc:link. A stable tag: or urn: URI as the identifier, and sioc:link<br />
for retrieving a representation. But that's additional complexity.<br />
You need two URIs instead of just one.</p>
<p>With HTTP URIs, you can use one URI as both name and address. If you<br />
put a bit of care into designing and maintaining your URI space, then<br />
you also get stability. Every publisher manages their own HTTP URI<br />
space and can decide for themselves how much effort they want to<br />
spend on stability. I think that's a pretty good solution.</p>
<p>> I totally agree with what you said in that email, but what would you<br />
> do? Getting rid of the sioc:link property or leaving it as it is?</p>
<p>As I said in the other post, I'd be in favor of removing sioc:link.<br />
IMO it introduces ambiguity and potential confusion. The best place<br />
for the post's URL is as the post's identifier, not in a separate<br />
property.</p>
<p>Just my €0.02.</p>

<p>I agree with you: keep it as simple as possible, not simpler (<br />

<p>I just read one blog post from someone on the mailing list (don't<br />
remember who) that was saying that we should focus on cut-off the<br />
redundancy with other existing ontologies. I agree with him and<br />
deprecating the sioc:link property goes in that trend. I think we<br />
should have a discussion about the use of properties like sioc:<br />
description (or dc:description), etc.</p>

<p>I just want to point out that each Wordpress comment does indeed have<br />
its own URL, something like:</p>
<p>http://dowhatimean.net/2006/06/more-cool-sparqlajax-stuff#comment-7739</p>
<p>I agree with the original poster, the URL should be used directly to<br />
identify the comment.</p>
<p>In the case where a Post really doesn't have a URL, the post won't<br />
have a sioc:link either, and you can fall back to using a blank node<br />
or a non-resolvable URI for the comment.</p>

<p>Could be a good idea, but we should think about what is part_of and<br />
has_part of a "community". Is it a User? a new entity? And we also<br />
have to place that new concept in relation with all the other ones<br />
(Site, Forum, Usergroup).</p>
<p>In fact, my question is: what would be the difference between a<br />
Usergroup and a Community (semantically)?</p>
<p>Because when I read the description of a Usergroup, it looks like a<br />
Community, doesn't it?: "A set of Users (accounts) who have a common<br />
purpose or interest. Can be used for access control purposes."</p>
<p>A Usergroup regroup users with commin puspose and/or interests,<br />
Communities regroup users considering what? I think we should define<br />
that.</p>

<p>If I understand right, the trackback thing only apply to Post that<br />
use the "trackback" protocol? In that case, it would mostly (if not<br />
only) apply to some blog posts, right? If so, I am not sure that it<br />
is a good idea considering that trackbacks are dying considering the<br />
spam problems. </p>
<p>My question here is: what is the "added-value" of trackbacks over<br />
normal "has_reply". Is it really useful to include two new properties<br />
to explicit the fact that a reply (a link) have been created using a<br />
trackback? Personally I don't think so.</p>

<p>Tell me if I am wrong, but the has_sibling and sibling_of properties<br />
could be use to "tag" replicated posts, right? In that case, a "has_<br />
sibling" post (the replicated one by an aggregator) could also add<br />
the "create_at" property. This way, we would know when it have been<br />
replicated.</p>
<p>I hope it helps you.</p>

<p>sioc:Community sounds like a good idea. Christoph commented earlier<br />
that a community is something that should have been in a SIOC ontology<br />
from the very begining..</p>
<p>A summary from a chat with Alex and John about sioc:Community:<br />
 - a sioc:Community acts as a container for all kinds of SIOC objects<br />
(maybe also other, non-SIOC objects?) and groups them together as<br />
belonging to this community.</p>
<p>This is the difference of sioc:Community and sioc:Usergroup:<br />
 - a usergroup keeps together a number of users (e.g., authors,<br />
administrators, ...)<br />
 - sioc:Community keeps together a number of different objects (Sites,<br />
people, ...)</p>
<p>E.g., a semantic web community may consist of a people, Planet RDF<br />
website, #swig web channel and its web scratchpad, some mailing lists,<br />
...</p>
<p>> A Usergroup regroup users with commin puspose and/or interests,<br />
> Communities regroup users considering what? I think we should define<br />
> that.</p>
<p>Yes, we should define what a Community is and how we will use it.</p>
<p>Related:<br />

 - http://apassant.net/blog/2006/06/29/97-rdf-export-of-sioc-wiki-content</p>
<p>I see that Alex already uses a sioc:Community is "RDF Export of SIOC<br />
Wiki Content" as a container for sioc:Site(s). One could ask in this<br />
case, though, what is the benefit from using sioc:Community and<br />
sioc:Site here over existing ways to specify a collection of URLs (to<br />
crawl or to import into RSS readers) using FOAF, OPML, etc...</p>

<p>Trackback is used in a variety of sites (though if we look only at<br />
community sites it's mainly blogs) - the idea is good, but the problem<br />
is spam. This problem has solutions, I believe.</p>
<p>A benefit of trackbacks is that it explicitly indicates a relation<br />
between posts. Semantics of the relation might be unclear but it is<br />
already better than nothing (and we can work on semantics of the<br />
relation further on).</p>
<p>One reason for adding trackbacks is to be able to express in SIOC as<br />
much as possible of the information on an community site. Trackbacks<br />
are part of such information (e.g., in b2evolution there are 3 types<br />
of comment objects - 'comments', 'trackback' and 'pingback').</p>
<p>If SIOC can keep all the details about community site it may act as a<br />
"medium" to transfer information between community sites and even<br />
migrate data from one site to another. This may be a tough call though<br />
(some information might not be available in SIOC export), but why deny<br />
ourselves the terms to express what is inside a site?</p>

<p>See above - if we don't distinguish between them we loose some<br />
information (and loose the ability to recreate the same structures<br />
elsewhere).</p>
<p>What we may think about is if we can better integrate trackbacks into<br />
the existing SIOC model.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the discussion on #swig i took a look at the rss<br />
trackback module (http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/<br />
trackback/) and it says:<br />
"trackback:about is a sub-element of an RSS item, and contains a<br />
TrackBack URL that was pinged in reference to this RSS item. Each RSS<br />
item may contain zero or more instances of trackback:about."</p>
<p>Understanding (and defining) a sioc:Post as a rss1.0:item would<br />
enable two things:</p>
<p>1) semantics of trackbacks are defined by RSS1.0 trackback module, and</p>
<p>2) SIOC goal of describing the structure of a Community (and it's<br />
Posts) with a focus on exchangability is reached</p>
<p>sioc:Post is already a foaf:Document, to better describe weblogs we<br />
should make it a subclass of rss1:item and skip sioc:trackback* from<br />
SIOC.</p>
<p>Making statements about what protocol was used to make a comment<br />
extends SIOC's domain from "describe community structures" to<br />
"describe community structures and technical infrastructure used by<br />
the community".</p>

<p>We were looking at the TrackBack module before and were thinking to<br />
reuse or invent new properties. You have good arguments for reuse.</p>
<p>However, there are couple of issues / questions to answer:</p>
<p>1) there is no RDF schema for RSS TrackBack module, hence no machine<br />
readable info about the schema / its semantics</p>
<p>2) how would you describe the other direction - that a particular post<br />
B has received trackback from post A ?</p>
<p>3) how would you express that the trackback was done (sent/received) at<br />
a particular time? trackback:about only allows to point to the URL that<br />
has been track-backed.</p>
<p>Subclassing sioc:Post from rss:item makes sense - unless there're some<br />
conflicts arising (which I do not see).</p>
<p>> Making statements about what protocol was used to make a comment<br />
> extends SIOC's domain from "describe community structures" to<br />

<p>It depends if we only want to extract information from community sites<br />
or also "reconstruct" as much information as possible about them.</p>
<p>Being able to use SIOC as a transport between 2 community sites is<br />
tempting, although not the main reason why we have or need SIOC.</p>
<p>Good thing is that in the solution you proposed we can distinguish<br />
between comments and trackbacks - so we keep the "technical data".</p>

<p>I think the first one is better, the association should be between<br />
the *person* and the post, not the *account* and the post. That's how<br />
dc:creator and foaf:maker work. Of course then you couldn't record<br />
any more that a single person posts from multiple accounts. From my<br />

I wouldn't worry about that. When you smush, you always lose some<br />
information. If someone cares about the association, then they<br />
shouldn't smush, or keep the original data around to check which<br />
source the triple is from.</p>

Is sioc:content really the same as sioc:description? FWIW,<br />
dc:description is defined as "An account of the content of the resource.<br />
Description may include but is not limited to: an abstract, table of<br />
contents, reference to a graphical representation of content or a<br />
free-text account of the content." I read this as some kind of<br />
summary of the content.</p>

There is rdf:type already, the most universal property in all of RDF.<br />

sioc:topic is pretty useless unless there's a method of actually<br />

with an equivalent of sioc:topic.</p>

I say drop it. For posts and forums, the resource URI should be the<br />
link. For users (and anything else), there's foaf:page/foaf:homepage<br />
already. If anybody needs more, there's still dc:identifier.</p>

<p>sioc:User concept describes an online account. It used to describe<br />
both an account and personal information associated with it but as<br />
person's information was moved to a foaf:Person, the name remains.</p>

<p>Currently we associate a post with an online account used to create<br />
this post. That allows to keep a link between posts and accounts they<br />
were made from. What are your suggestions and why would you want to<br />
loose this information?</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment. A number of people have already commented that<br />
a dc:description is more appropriate for an abstract of a post than<br />
for a full text content. Or, in other words, that by using<br />
dc:description to describe full contents of a post we are implying<br />
additional semantics on this property that it does not have.</p>
<p>We should not dc:description for post content then.</p>
<p>Where does that leave us? A simple solution is to use sioc:content.</p>

<p>Not sure about this. Using external vocabulary like SKOS for topics is<br />
preferred but we can't guarantee that all SIOC data will always have<br />
one. Currently there are no SKOS categories in the WordPress SIOC<br />
export [yet], but if there is sioc:topic that helps already.</p>

One what? I'll take "topic".<br />
I interpret that to mean that some particular "topic" has been<br />
assigned or named yet. I suppose there are other interpretations.<br />
Maybe I'm off base here, but I cannot think of an instance of data of<br />
any kind that doesn't exist within some context, eg, some subject or<br />
basket of subjects. Let "subject" stand as a synonym for "topic."<br />
That, of course, is difficult; the xml topic maps folks refer "topic"<br />
as a kind of container that represents (proxies, stands for, whatever)<br />
some "subject". It is my opinion that the SIOC ontology should make a<br />
few ontological commitments to some terms, such as topic, subject, and<br />
so forth; those commitments are necessary since the ontology is trying<br />
to exist in several namespaces.  If it is a requirement (as implied by<br />
the quote) that a topic must exist prior to data  being represented,<br />
then I must be missing something.</p>
<p>Just a half EURO for the morning. No wait!...afternoon.<br />

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hi all,<br /><br />
<br />A bit late, but here are a few remarks about the proposed changes:<br />
<div><span class="gmail_quote"><br /><br />
</span><br />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">=1= Use foaf:Person instead of sioc:User for person's data<br /><br />Name, surname and other personal data will be described via a<br />
<br />foaf:Person, which will point to the sioc:User (person's account on the<br />community site) using foaf:holdsAccount property.</blockquote></div></p>
<div><br /><br />
I also think this is the best way to do mapping between FOAF and SIOC.<br />(detail: as sioc:User will be a foaf:OnlineAccount, maybe naming it sioc:Account/UserAccount would be better than sioc:User)<br /><br />
There's also might be a sioc:owned_by property to make a<br />
sioc:User/Account point to a foaf:Person  (as it doesn't seem<br />
there's an inverse of foaf:holdsAccount yet).<br /><br />
Then, there could be a sioc:accountName, to define the Account name / login, which might be a subclass/sameAs of foaf:accountName.<br />
</div>
<p><br /><br />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">

<div><br /><br />
Regarding the location of the user, I think it's better to let FOAF manage it, eg<br />
using Geo vocabulary [1]. And maybe keep sioc:location for the location of a post ?<br />
</div>

<p> - text (e.g., keywords) described by sioc:subject<br /> - resources (e.g., SKOS concepts) described by sioc:topic</p>

<br />versions of the data? Currently we have rather simple next_version,<br />previous_version and has_modifier, modifier_of. Another option is to<br />introduce &quot;modification events&quot; that we can add more information to [at<br />
<br />a cost of the complexity of data/ontology]</p></blockquote>
<div><br />If previous / next are transitive properties, and using created_at and has_creator /has_modifier for each versionned Post, I think we can get all relevant information about versions of the data.<br />
<br />Yet, a version_comment attribute could be added to sioc:Post, so that each post may have a short description about its revision (eg: &quot;initial version&quot;, &quot;typo...&quot; as we can do in some wikis, or in CVS).<br />

<p>I had the same question, but in the mean time, I would (and will: for a project I am working on right now, more information in this later) use a "rdfs:seeAlso" property to create the bridge between a sioc:User and it's personal profile (foaf:Person).</p>
<p>I don't know if it is better then incorporating a new sioc property but considering that it is a common practice to refer a "foaf:knows" property to the "knows"'s Foaf profile, it could do the job for the moment I think. Are my assumptions good?</p>

<p>A good suggestion. sioc:name was meant for this purpose (according to<br />
changes in new ontology version when it is no longer needed for<br />
expressing short name of something), but we did not think of<br />
accountName property that is inherited from FOAF.</p>
<p>Do others have suggestions which to use - sioc:name or foaf:accountName?</p>
<p>Note: sioc:name is meant to be used for both sioc:User and Usergroup.<br />
Although I can not remember right now what is the rationale for<br />
account names in case of Usergroup. Maybe John knows more about this.</p>

describing topics of Posts (see the figure below). There you can see<br />
different ways of describing topics. May be useful for integrating<br />
SKOS.</p>

<p>We can use previous / next properties for now. Shall we make them<br />
transitive then? And what questions does that help us to answer from<br />
the data?</p>
<p>We will need to develop this the future - when looking at a use case<br />
where versions are more important than in a blog or forum posts (e.g.,<br />
wikis).</p>
<p>Here's a wiki page for discussion, please add your comments:<br />
