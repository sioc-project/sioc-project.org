  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>There is a section below with the title "Atheism and Evolutionism are<br />
WRONG."</p>
<p>All those who have sinned deserve to suffer in Hell forever. "Pride"<br />
is an example of a sin.</p>
<p>1. Repent (be truly sorry for your sins; beg for God's forgiveness;<br />
abandon sin; ask Him to help you stop sinning; and repent for His<br />
sake).</p>
<p>2. Completely trust in God only; do not trust in yourself.</p>
<p>3. Love the Lord with all of your heart.</p>
<p>The Son of God (the Lord Jesus Christ) suffered and died on the cross<br />
to pay for the sins of those who trust in Him. His blood can clean<br />
away our sins. He was buried for three days, then lived again. There<br />
is hope of eternal life and happiness for those who trust in God.</p>
<p>Your efforts and works cannot save you. Only God is truly righteous<br />
and good. Humans are totally corrupt, but thankfully God controls all<br />
things. Thank the Lord if He has saved you, and if His Spirit has<br />
given you the ability to trust in Him.</p>
<p>There is no better God than Him.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Atheism and Evolutionism are wrong:</p>
<p>An atheist is a person who does not believe in God.</p>
<p>God is the Intelligent Creator of the Universe.</p>
<p>If you refuse to trust in God, it's not my loss.</p>
<p>1. Energy/matter cannot be created from nothing nor destroyed<br />
(completely annihilated) through natural methods.</p>
<p>2. The Universe cannot create itself. If it created itself, then<br />
anything can create itself; and the Universe can have a "Mind" of its<br />
own.</p>
<p>3. Fine-tuning of the Universe: At least 50 physical constants HAVE<br />
BEEN SET CORRECTLY by God for the Universe and life to exist.</p>
<p>4. Laws of physics do not order themselves. They have no goals.<br />
5. No oscillating universe; no multiverse.<br />
6. Universe moving towards entropy (or heat death).<br />
7. Planets do not form through natural methods.<br />
8. Gases scatter/dissipate quickly. Therefore, Jupiter have been<br />
created.<br />
9. Saturn has three rings. They have been set in place.<br />
10. A Theory: the Earth is near the center of the Universe. This idea<br />
supports the Bible.<br />
11. The Earth is not millions of years old. Notes: Magnetic field<br />
decay; Archaeology; History, other "Time limiters." Ancient people<br />
were as smart as modern men. Evolutionists have no excuse.</p>
<p>DNA cannot exist in natural environments longer than 10,000 years;<br />
yet, these have been FOUND in Neanderthal bones, insects in amber,<br />
Dinosaur fossils, etc. A dinosaur fossil was discovered still having<br />
soft tissue and blood cells.</p>
<p>Other keywords: Squashed Polonium-210 halos, Orphan Polonium-218,<br />
Helium loss from zircon, Carbon-14 in deep geological strata.</p>
<p>12. Misplaced fossils; Wrong sequence of geological strata/layers;<br />
Polystrate fossils are enemies of Uniformitarianism and Evolution.<br />
Example: Fish fossils in the "Cambrian" strata.</p>
<p>13. Decay rates are not constant. Note: Even the speed of light is not<br />
constant. As for radiometric dating methods: At least one of them<br />
showed that primate skull KNM-ER 1470 was "212-230 million years old."<br />
Even evolutionists rejected it.</p>
<p>Claystone dating using K-Ar in 1986: 135.2 ± 5.5 Million years old;<br />
Dating using Ar-Ar In 1991: 152.9 ± 1.2 Million years old. About "11<br />
million years" of decay have occured in just 5 years.</p>
<p>Carbon-14 production rate exceeds decay by 30%. Thus, Earth's<br />
atmosphere is less than 30,000 years old.</p>
<p>14. NATURAL life can only come from life. Abiogenesis (or spontaneous<br />
generation) is impossible.<br />
Keyword: Chirality.</p>
<p>15. The DNA double-helix, self-repair codes, self-checking system/<br />
algorithms, structure, DNA language convention, irreducible cell<br />
complexity, and chromosome count are enemies of evolution.</p>
<p>16. DNA of humans differ/vary by about 10-12% from each other. 50% of<br />
human DNA is identical to the DNA of a banana. Humans and apes have no<br />
common ancestor.</p>
<p>17. Common sense and science reveal the fact of "Intelligent Design."<br />
There are cells which are more complex than New York City or modern<br />
space shuttles. Also read Genesis chapter 3 in the Bible.</p>
<p>18. There is no real vestigial/useless organ. There is no junk DNA.<br />
Note: Males' nipples "arouse" women.</p>
<p>19. Mutations are harmful, deadly, and destructive to genetic codes.<br />
Example: Cancer.</p>
<p>20. Natural selection and Sexual selection seem unable to eliminate<br />
destructive genetic codes. Natural Selection is conservative, not<br />
innovative.</p>
<p>21. The fossil record and the "Cambrian Explosion" reveal Creationism<br />
and the Global Flood, not evolution. There were NO "mice-bats" with<br />
one wing or two wings each having 25% bone structure. There were NO<br />
walking fishes.</p>
<p>22. The Lord gave humans a conscience, morals, and advanced<br />
intelligence.<br />
23. Strong evidence of a Global Flood in the past. This fact supports<br />
the Bible. Geologic layers were formed quickly and catastrophically.<br />
Notes: Hydro-plate theory, Carbon-14 disequilibrium, Rapid sedimentary<br />
burial of fossils, etc.</p>
<p>24. No historical record gives clues about "evolution."<br />
25. Scientists can use false or "biased" data. Examples: Piltdown man<br />
deception, Lucy mistake, Archaeopteryx mistake, Peppered moth blunder<br />
and fraud.</p>
<p>26. Evolution is science fiction (a myth). It is similar to the story<br />
of the Centaurs (horse-men) and Mermaids (fish-women). I don't believe<br />
in Centaurs and Mermaids.</p>
<p>27. Philosophers love wisdom. But, only God is truly wise. Atheists<br />
are not philosophers. They are not free-thinkers.</p>
<p>28. Science is closely related to knowledge or information. These<br />
things are useless if there is no God. True scientists trust in the<br />
Creator of the Universe. Examples: Newton, Pasteur, Linnaeus, Faraday,<br />
Pascal, Kelvin, Maxwell, Kepler, etc.</p>
<p>29. Atheism or evolution does not provide a solid foundation for<br />
morality. If there is no God, there is no good nor evil.</p>
<p>30. Evolution is a myth. Even if it is true, there are evolutionists<br />
who believe in God.<br />
31. Every time atheists and evolutionists cannot answer a valid<br />
question, they say, "It's an Unexplained Mystery." Thus, they have<br />
blind faith.</p>
<p>32. Evolutionistic experiments with fruit flies failed to produce<br />
"something else" than a fruit fly.</p>
<p>33. Darwinian researchers accept that "Mitochondrial Eve" (also known<br />
as "African Eve") probably existed 6,000 years ago. All humans seem to<br />
have descended from this "Eve" and her male partner. This idea<br />
supports the Bible.</p>
<p>34. Stars can THEORETICALLY form through natural processes ONLY IF<br />
there is enough mass, a strong enough gravitational force, and an<br />
"igniter." The igniter is unknown or not available.</p>
<p>35. Problems with the Big Bang theory: Origin of matter, Black Hole<br />
(or gravitational force) dilemma, Explosions do not produce order,<br />
etc.</p>
<p>36. Evolutionism has several ridiculous ideas. Examples: Humans and<br />
apes have a common ancestor or humans descended from apes/fishes;<br />
fishes evolved into walking reptiles; reptiles to mammals or birds;<br />
mice to bats; lizards to dinosaurs; dogs to dolphins to whales; etc.</p>
<p>37. The studies done by Creationist Scientists regarding parasitic<br />
schistosomes reveal the possibility that there was a perfect<br />
environment in the past where these parasites were NOT harmful to<br />
their host(s). Rather, there was a mutualistic (friendly)<br />
relationship.</p>
<p>After this perfect environment has been destroyed, the schistosomes<br />
have begun invading the wrong hosts, thereby producing diseases. Such<br />
findings support the Creation account of Genesis chapters 1 to 3.</p>
<p>38. "Evolution" is a system that involved millions of years of trials-<br />
and-errors, naturalistic processes, suffering, misery, death, and<br />
natural selection.</p>
<p>Would the Perfect Christian God use evolution to create humans and<br />
animals? Would He allow suffering and death even before Adam and Eve<br />
had sinned?</p>
<p>39. Our God is Master and Lord over science.</p>
<p>40. All those who have sinned deserve to suffer in Hell forever. If<br />
God is real, atheism loses. If God is not real, atheism still loses.</p>

<p>If you refuse to accept the truth, it's not my loss. You have been<br />
given a chance. Trust in the Creator of the Universe. There are only<br />
two options: 1) Ignorance + Eternal suffering, and 2) Eternal life +<br />
joy.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Notes for Jews:</p>
<p>Your Messiah (Saviour) has arrived over 2,000 years ago: He is the Son<br />
of God who became a man, suffered and died on the cross, and lived<br />
again from the dead; was prophesied in Isaiah 53, and in the book of<br />
Daniel.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Notes for Christians:</p>
<p>1. Don't waste your time with those who don't want to trust in God. It<br />
is enough that we warn them only ONCE. If they refuse to repent, it's<br />
because the Lord did not transform their "hearts." There are millions<br />
of people who have not yet heard about the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>2. You are not required to make donations nor any service to your<br />
church. "Tithes" were for the Levites. Numbers 18:24. God does not<br />
need our help, but you are encouraged to serve. Also, please read<br />
Colossians 2:16-17. Serve the Lord with joy and gladness.</p>
<p>3. I recommend the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. It has<br />
prevailed/won over false science (such as evolutionism); crushed the<br />
opposers; changed the hearts of many; revealed truths (including<br />
future events) from God.</p>
<p>There are people who claim that the Bible has "errors." Note: The<br />
Bible is a guide. The interpretation(s), understanding, wisdom, and<br />
faith come from God.</p>
<p>4. Salvation cannot be lost. Fact: Our God does not make mistakes. If<br />
you sin, He will discipline you. Hebrews 13.</p>
<p>5. Hell is eternal. Isaiah 66:24; Matthew 25:41. The more sins a<br />
person does, the greater his suffering: Luke 12:47-48.</p>
<p>6. Faith is a gift of God. You have nothing to be proud of. Ephesians<br />
2:8-9.</p>
<p>7. Live by faith. Don't be too strict with the law.</p>
<p>8. Interesting topics:</p>
<p>Sovereignty of God - The Lord rules over all. He follows His own<br />
plans.</p>
<p>Characteristics of God: Omnipotence, Omniscience, Omnipresence,<br />
Spirit, Triune, Self-existent, Eternal, Immutable, Holy, Truthful,<br />
Loving, Just, Merciful.</p>
<p>Trinity: There is only one God, and God has three persons: Father,<br />
Son, and Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Total depravity - Humans are totally corrupt.</p>
<p>Unconditional Election - Before God created the Universe, He has<br />
chosen those whom He will save.</p>
<p>Particular Redemption - The Lord Jesus Christ died for those who trust<br />
in Him.</p>
<p>Irresistible Grace - All those who were chosen will be saved at the<br />
appointed time(s).</p>
<p>Perseverance of the saints - Because of God's help, those who trust in<br />
Him will continue for all eternity.</p>
<p>Elements of human nature - Body and spirit.</p>
<p>New Birth - the Spirit of God transforms those who trust in Him.</p>

<p>If you accuse me of "lying, hypocrisy, etc.," I'm not affected with<br />
your accusations. The Lord knows my intentions.</p>
<p>About the atheist's "Invisible Pink Unicorn:" if she did not create<br />
the Universe, then it is not important to me if she exists or not.</p>
<p>Repent, then trust in the Son of God: The Lord Jesus Christ. He is THE<br />
WAY, THE TRUTH, and THE LIFE. No man comes unto the Father except<br />
through Him.</p>
