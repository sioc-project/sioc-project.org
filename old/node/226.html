  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>Hi all -</p>
<p>I'm just kicking off a discussion to try and finalise some additions we<br />
are trying to make to SIOC to allow it to cover many other "Web 2.0"<br />
community sites where content is posted in a forum or container area of<br />
a site and then may also be commented on (like in a discussion thread).<br />
Some examples are Flickr, Upcoming.org, YouTube, SlideShare, etc.</p>
<p>For a picture of what we have in mind, see:</p>
<p>http://www.johnbreslin.com/blog/2007/03/01/linking-personal-posted-content-across-communities/</p>
<p>The inner layer is a person (in FOAF), the next layer is their user<br />
accounts (FOAF, SIOC) and the outer stuff is the posted content (text,<br />
files, associated metadata) in SIOC.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(1) SIOC types</p>
<p>Kingsley created a nice list of SIOC types, i.e. types of various forums<br />
/ containers and the posted content therein.  I am going through this<br />
list, adding some new types and trying to choose generic names where<br />
possible.  Note that these types are totally optional, and could be used<br />
as an additional rdf:type so that tools that use sioc:Forum / Post would<br />
still work okay.</p>
<p>The current list is at http://wiki.sioc-project.org/index.php/TypesModule</p>
<p>Ideas can be added to the page.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(2) Posts and connected content (linked or embedded files or metadata)</p>
<p>So far, sioc:Posts have content, attachment and links_to properties<br />
which cover a lot of discussion content scenarios.</p>
<p>It seems that we may still need a few more properties, e.g.<br />
content_enhanced, embeds, etc.</p>
<p>The content_enhanced could be HTML-enhanced text, text with BB / wiki<br />
codes, or maybe even a series of chunks of plain text and RDF metadata.<br />
This property could also link to an AtomOWL Content object.  Uldis<br />
proposed sioc:body for this property some time back.</p>
<p>The embeds property could allow files to be viewed (e.g. remote video<br />
files) or embedded metadata to be incorporated (e.g. in some structured<br />
/ semantic blog posts, so that embeds -> object with metadata) in a<br />
post.  There may be a distinction between something that is attached and<br />
something that is embedded - the former may not be displayed in the post<br />
whereas the latter is - and something that is attached may also be embedded.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to use something instead of attachment / embeds<br />
that can be used interchangeably, e.g. includes or contains (although<br />
the latter confuses with sioc:has_container).  This would remove<br />
ambiguity over which to use (if someone won't use both).</p>
<p>Myself and Uldis have been wracking our heads trying to come up with the<br />
best way to do this, so it'd be good to have your ideas on this.  The<br />
names content_enhanced or embeds are just ideas, better ones are welcome.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>(3) > Forums, Posts</p>
<p>Another suggestion from Kingsley was to have something greater than the<br />
concept of a Forum so that posted content could be grouped together<br />
(e.g. book reviews in a review channel, etc.).  This would involve<br />
superclasses of Forum and Post (and maybe Site), e.g. Container and<br />
Content (and Space) or something like that.  I'm almost afraid to<br />
introduce such terms as we are perhaps creating something that can<br />
describe anything, rather than online communities.  For now, I'd hope<br />
that solutions for (1) and (2) will suffice, and may also be more<br />
semantically constrained.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>That's it so far, opinions welcome!</p>
<p>John.<br />

<p>The list of SIOC types at [1] looks good. There may be some<br />
fine-tuning of SIOC types as we implement them, some properties may be<br />
moved up from Post to Item, but all in all it is a good start and lets<br />
us move forward.</p>

<p>To abstract a little, we may look at Post/Item and 3 kinds of<br />
properties / relations related to it:</p>
<p>a) Full content of a post/item.</p>
<p>We need a property that allows to express full content of a post (what<br />
you'd call a body of a post), in different representations. And need<br />
to be able to tell what representation this content is in.</p>
<p>[GNU] made an earlier suggestion how to do this in [2] using Atom/OWL.<br />
We still need a property that would link a Post/Item to aowl:Content<br />
and possible candidate names are body (as proposed in earlier posts),<br />
content_enhanced, or any new suggestions.</p>
<p>[2] http://b4mad.net/datenbrei/archives/2006/08/21/sioc-and-atomowl-a-new-way-to-describe-content/</p>
<p>We can then model all different versions of content in SIOC using this<br />
pattern and attach appropriate MIME type to them. E.g., a post<br />
description can contain both its content in Wiki markup and in HTML.<br />
Another usage of this pattern is to represent versions of a post in<br />
different languages.</p>
<p>Existing properties used SIOC to describe post content: sioc:content,<br />
content:encoded.</p>
<p>b) "Things" contained within / linked to from a Post/Item</p>
<p>A Post/Item may contain or link to objects which we may want to tell<br />
more about. Things contained within a post can be an Image, or a<br />
Review. Things linked to from an item can be a video or a<br />
presentation. There may also be attachments to an Item which do not<br />
appear in a post (e.g. a wiki page may contain an attachment which is<br />
not linked to from a page).</p>
<p>> The embeds property could allow files to be viewed (e.g. remote video<br />

<p>Existing properties: attachment, links_to</p>
<p>Needed: a property that points to things that a post/item contains.<br />
Suggestions: embeds, contains, or any new suggestion.</p>
<p>c) "Things" and concepts that a post/item is about</p>
<p>We want to tell what [things or concepts] a post or item is about.</p>
<p>John did not mention this kind of relations directly but there is a<br />
thin line between the things a post/item is about and things contained<br />
within a post/item. Existing properties: sioc:topic to point to<br />
category and tag URIs (with an rdfs:label to add a text label);<br />
dc:subject to express plain text keywords.</p>
<p>Currently SIOC expresses categories and tags, but does not tell how to<br />
say that this is "a post about film F1" or "a post about presentation<br />
P1 by person X". We need a way to do this.</p>
<p>Option: Use a sioc:topic pointing to [the URI of] the object a<br />
post/item is about. This is a generic way how to describe relation to<br />
any kind of an object. Type / class of the object can then specify<br />
what kind of an object this is.</p>

<p>We talked about this on IRC and I suggested</p>
<p>* that the property could be has_piece, because we already have<br />
sioc:contains and sioc:has_part (both with unrelated meanings)<br />
* that we could use awol:Content as the type of attachments, e.g.</p>
<p>post sioc:has_piece [ a awol:Content; awol:src <foo1823.jpg> ].</foo1823.jpg></p>
<p>The spec of awol:Content is here:</p>
<p>http://bblfish.net/work/atom-owl/2006-06-06/AtomOwl.html#Content<br />
===<br />
Content Class - see §4.1.3 in rfc 4287 One way to think of this is as<br />
a class that represents what one can get from an HTTP connection. It<br />
has a body, and a number of headers, info such as mime-type,<br />
content-lenght, etc... .<br />
===</p>
<p>So an instance of awol:Content doesn't need to be the content of<br />
anything, even though Atom/OWL does use it for the content of feeds,<br />
and using it for attachments doesn't conflict with using it for the<br />
main content of a post. The reason I'm suggesting it is that it would<br />
allow us to use the same RDF structure for including attachments in<br />
the RDF (through awol:body) and referring to them externally (through<br />
awol:src).</p>

<p>I'd suggest using foaf:topic.</p>
<p>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#term_topic<br />
===<br />
The foaf:topic property relates a document to a thing that the<br />
document is about.</p>
<p>As such it is an inverse of the foaf:page property, which relates a<br />
thing to a document about that thing.<br />

<p> - sioc:has_piece sounds ok (though "piece" may mean a "gun" to some)<br />
 - we can also reuse sioc:has_part if we subclass sioc:Community from<br />
a container (and from has_part from it)<br />
 - sioc:contains is another option, but bad because there's already<br />
sioc:content.</p>
<p>Thoughts about the sioc:embeds - it (and also sioc:attachment) is more<br />
specific than sioc:contains / has_part / has_piece. Therefore a need<br />
for a generic property discussed here, with sioc:embeds and<br />
sioc:attachment being special cases (subproperties) of it.</p>
<p>About hierarchies of new classes and properties:</p>
<p>We see an "explosion" of subtypes for sioc:Post / sioc:Item. When we<br />
add some new subtypes of Post there appears a need for even more.<br />
E.g., just added MailMessage and InstantMessage, but Tukkah on #sioc<br />
is exporting IRC logs in SIOC (as sioc:Post for now).</p>
<p>Questions:<br />
 - Do we also need a sioc:IrcMessage then?<br />
 - Private messages in IRC? - are those IrcMessage(s) or InstantMessage(s).<br />
 - How are sioc:MailMessage and sioc:InstantMessage different?</p>
<p>Could someone working on expressing e-mail, instant and Usenet<br />
messages in SIOC tell his thoughts about this?</p>
<p>If we need new classes and properties we should add those. But we<br />
should also look at the new additions and see maybe we need to<br />
refactor these changes - e.g., if two of the new classes are<br />
essentially the same.</p>

<p>awol:Content is very generic, that's nice. We can use both awol:body<br />
for literal content and awol:src for content that is located<br />
elsewhere. Interesting, have to see how it is used. This does not mean<br />
awol:Content has to be used for all kinds of content, but it is a good<br />
candidate for some.</p>
<p>You have shown an example of using it with has_piece, but it suits<br />
even better when talking about different representations of a message.</p>
<p>We also need a property to connect a Post / Item to a representation<br />
of its body. sioc:body (sioc:has_body) and sioc:content_enhanced were<br />
mentioned. Out of these two I'd prefer sioc:has_body.</p>
<p>While content_enhanced was the best option we could think during the<br />
meeting, body of the message is actually not enhanced, the opposite is<br />
true - sioc:content is a stripped-down plain text content and<br />
sioc:<new property name> is a normal content, possibly in different<br />
representations.</new></p>
<p>One more option is to use sioc:content for both (a) literal plain-text<br />
content and (b) for real resources, e.g., of type awol:Content.</p>
<p>Question: is it a good idea to mix both types of content in the same property?</p>
<p>There was also a suggestion (by Kingsley?) to introduce<br />
sioc:text_content (or similar) property and use it for what is<br />
sioc:content now, leaving sioc:content for the real resources. But how<br />
does this influence existing implementations and users of SIOC data?<br />
We don't want to break what is already being used.</p>

<p>Currently, I use sioc:topic to link a post to any rdf:Resource (while<br />
keeping dc:subject for the original "tag", as Uldis mentionned)<br />
eg (in my post):<br />
<http://foobar> a sioc:Post .<br />
<http://foobar> sioc:topic <http://movie1> .</http://movie1></http://foobar></http://foobar></p>
<p>and (in another RDF document where I defined the movie)<br />
<http://movie1> a xxx:Movie<br />
[...]</http://movie1></p>
<p>But, actually, I've never realized the overlap between foaf:topic and<br />
sioc:topic ... but seems they're the same ? Maybe we should re-use<br />
foaf:topic (would be OK since a sioc:Post subclassOf foaf:Document)<br />
directly, or at least make it a subproperty of foaf:topic</p>

<p>I think the problem with reusing foaf:topic was that we wanted to use<br />
sioc:topic to talk about topics linked to a User, Site, etc. which<br />
aren't foaf:Documents (although sioc:Post is subclassed)...</p>

<p>Thanks. That's why we have sioc:topic. Additional benefit is that we<br />
can explain the use of sioc:topic within the SIOC ontology and<br />
specification, or change it when revisions are needed.</p>
<p>Benja is right, sioc:topic is one the properties which we can use and<br />
should change.</p>
<p>We can continue to use sioc:topic for tags, categories and<br />
skos:Concepts. And since it can be any URI we can also use it to point<br />
to the resources a Post / Item is about (maybe with some changes to<br />
its rdfs:comment).</p>
<p>When we do that we will need a way to distinguish between different<br />
kinds of topics - what are tags, what are categories and what are the<br />
_things_ a post is about. Solution: to use the rdf:type of the URI<br />
which sioc:topic points to determine what it is. E.g.:</p>
<p>post_1 sioc:topic resource_A .<br />
resource_A a skos:Project .</p>
<p>To distinguish when a topic points to a category or tag new types of<br />
topics can be added to types module. E.g.:</p>
<p>post_1 sioc:topic topic_SW .<br />
topic_SW a sioct:Category .</p>
<p>This is a generic model how to express what a post is about, building<br />
on the sioc:topic we are already using.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to use both sioc:topic and foaf:topic. John<br />
outlines one of the reasons why it is not done. Another thing - it can<br />
very confusing if both are used. Best we can do is learn from FOAF and<br />
change / improve sioc:topic as needed.</p>
<p>Finally finished writing all about changes needed. Time to go to sleep. :)</p>

<p>Actually, sioc:topic is different in the specification, and foaf:topic<br />
seems to be what you want. Or is that one of the things that you guys<br />
were planning to change? The current SIOC specification has the<br />
following example:</p>
<p>:post\_123<br />
    a sioc:Post ;<br />
    sioc:topic <http://dmoz.org/Business/Publishing\_and\_Printing/> .</http://dmoz.org/business/publishing\_and\_printing/></p>
<p>The intent would appear to be to express that :post\_123 is about<br />
publishing and printing, *not* that it is about the *page*<br />
<http://dmoz.org/Business/Publishing\_and\_Printing/> (which would be<br />
the meaning if we used foaf:topic instead of sioc:topic).</http://dmoz.org/business/publishing\_and\_printing/></p>
<p>http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/#term_topic</p>
<p>I think we should use the FOAF property if we want its semantics:<br />
duplicating it as a SIOC property doesn't strike me as useful...</p>

      <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We (SIOC development community) are looking forward to your<br />
suggestions on how to connect blog posts (expressed as sioc:Posts)<br />
with different types of data / content that these posts contain or are<br />
about. All comments are welcome.</p>
<p>Copying this to FOAF-Dev and DOAP-Interest lists because software<br />
projects in DOAP can be one of the things people want to talk about.<br />
And FOAF is already integrated in RDF data exported by SIOC enabled<br />
forums and weblog, which means that developments in one can also help<br />
the other.</p>
<p>You will a detailed description of this question at the original<br />

it which can be found below.</p>

    <h3><a href="226.html#comment-357" class="active">SIOC types and posts with embedded/attached content</a></h3>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I finally had a look at the posts, the wiki and schemas.</p>
<p>I agree with the "Certain" types of the wiki page (BTW, It was spammed again!).<br />
I think that's important - from the Online Community point of view -<br />
to mention a post is from a Wiki, a blog, an e-mail ... since it is<br />
what makes its own nature.</p>
<p>Yet, I've got a different feeling with other types.<br />
I think telling a post / or a forum is en EventPost, LocationPost ...<br />
is not about its nature, but about its content.<br />
And by saying that, we'll merge the aspects of defining a class and<br />
its properties; if I refer to some notions of how to define this in<br />
upper ontologies such as DOLCE [1] ... a class must be defined when<br />
things won't change, else use property.<br />
Their example is something like Person is a class, Musician is a<br />
"quality", since it will always be a person, but can be another kind<br />
of artist in the future.<br />
I think that the same distinction should be done between what kind of<br />
post is it (blog, wiki ...) and what is it about (event, people ...)</p>
<p>Here, I rather think we should have a best practive saying that if<br />
you're blogging about an event use a "sioc:Post sioc:embeds ical:Event<br />
(if I understood well the meaning of embed) statement to mention it,<br />
with the given types table that list a lot of interesting types to be<br />
used in Web 2.0 communities.</p>
<p>And would consider as real types, as subclass of sioc:Post, only a few as<br />
- BlogPost<br />
- MailMessage<br />
- BoardPost<br />
- WikiArticle<br />
- PodcastPost<br />
- BookmarkPost<br />
- PollEntry<br />
and maybe comment</p>
<p>* Maybe I missed something about Container / Space, but I can't see<br />
what - still in this scope - what brings to the model ? Or maybe a top<br />
class besides Forum / Site is enought if we want to say "A space that<br />
contains Web 2.0 things" ?</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Alex.</p>

<p>All of the things we want to describe (video, bookmarks, CVs, reviews,<br />
...) are items (or objects), but not all of them fall within a more<br />
specific definition of a Post. Similarly, not all collections of items<br />
are discussion forums - e.g., a "file briefcase" is not.</p>
<p>Indeed a [Container / Space] is something that contains things or<br />
items. sioc:Forum is a subclass of Container. And sioc:Post would be a<br />
subclass of an item.</p>

<p>Yes, only some of those things should be considered subtypes of Forum,<br />
the others would be types of Containers...</p>
<p>The images on<br />
http://www.johnbreslin.com/blog/2007/03/03/proposed-classes-for-sioc-types-module/ should hopefully show the subclassing a bit clearer (this has changed from that proposed on the wiki<br />
page).</p>
