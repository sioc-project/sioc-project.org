  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>Hello there.</p>
<p>As Eyal Oren has announced on this list a few days ago, we developed a<br />
SIOC explorer web application, which usually can be found at:<br />
http://www.activerdf.org/sioc/</p>
<p>The new version of the SIOC explorer, allows you to see all posts in<br />
the database from all forums for one day, week or month. You can<br />
browse all posts written by one author.<br />
If more then one forum in the database use topics with the same label,<br />
then you can also view all posts with that topic label.</p>
<p>The SIOC explorer has been submitted to the Semantic Web scripting<br />
challenge,<br />
(http://www.semanticscripting.org/SFSW2007/)<br />
and I have written a short 2 page description of it.</p>
<p>During the development of the SIOC explorer I had a few insights and<br />
ideas regarding SIOC data and how it is currently used by some<br />
exporters:</p>
<p>phpBB export:<br />
========<br />
When using the SIOC data from http://sioc-project.org/forum , I could<br />
not help but notice, that the sioc:posts do not have any content.<br />
Is this by design? I would strongly encourage exporting the content of<br />
the posts by the phpBB exporter.</p>
<p>use of inverse properties:<br />
==============<br />
Currently the output of the wordpress exporter often only uses one<br />
direction in cases in which a property is available in both<br />
directions, like: sioc:container_of and sioc:has_container.<br />
Most non-java RDF libraries current don't support inferring of inverse<br />
properties (AFAIK).</p>
<p>It has been explained to me, that the decision to export only one<br />
direction has been made on the side of the wordpress exporter, but now<br />
imagine that every exporter chooses a different way to treat bi-<br />
directional properties.</p>
<p>The application developer cant make any assumption about which<br />
direction of the property will be used, and has to handle both cases<br />
in his application logic.</p>
<p>I would advocate using both directions in every exporter. In the end,<br />
humans neither create nor read or process the rdf data, and this makes<br />
it easier for the currently sometimes primitive rdf inferencing<br />
support of various scripting languages.</p>
<p>use of dc:created<br />
==========</p>
<p>Again, this is due to non inferencing triple stores:</p>
<p>In order to provide the basic functionality of every RSS aggregator,<br />
the user has to be able to view the posts sorted temporaly, and he<br />
will want to see posts which where created during a specific time<br />
span.</p>
<p>Currently most triple stores, even advanced ones dont support finding<br />
dates by time period. So we had to materialize the dc:created<br />
timestamp, like this:<br />
siocex:month, siocex:day, siocex:year, siocex:week.</p>
<p>I think there is no easy solution for this, except to wait for triple<br />
stores to support xsd:date.</p>
<p>creator of "real posts" and "replies" is different:<br />
===========================</p>
<p>In the output of the wordpress exporter, "real posts" have the<br />
sioc:creator property and "comments for posts" have the foaf:maker<br />
property, if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>I am not sure of the motivation for this, but it might be useful to<br />
consider using the same type of entity for both.</p>
<p>That would enable object consolidation for creators of posts: I could<br />
click on the creator of a post, and then see als his posts but also<br />
all the comments he wrote.</p>
<p>Of course the real reason for this, is the one, which I will discuss<br />
at the end of this email.</p>
<p>sioc:topic is always site specific:<br />
==================</p>
<p>Reusing sioc:topic right now across site borders is extremely<br />
difficult.<br />
The wordpress exporter prepends the site url in front of the category/<br />
tag used on the blog.</p>
<p>Currently in the SIOC explorer, we consolidate topics if their labels<br />
are downcased similar.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no easy solution to consolidate topics, or to come<br />
up with shared URIs for topics.</p>
<p>URLs in general are not shared<br />
==================</p>
<p>In general, the data from the wordpress exporter exhibits the problem<br />
that all instances of concepts have global URIs, but almost no URIs<br />
are reused between sites.</p>
<p>To state it in a provocative manner:<br />
The only benefit of using SIOC right now compared to RSS, is that the<br />
modelling focus is not so much on articles/posts but also on users/<br />
authors and their connections.</p>
<p>Advocates of RSS can counter the argument "SIOC data enables different<br />
types of sites to publish their content in a unified format" with the<br />
simple argument "a lof of different sites currently also just use<br />
RSS".</p>
<p>So what needs to change in order for SIOC data to be useful in a way<br />
that RSS data will never be:</p>
<p>URIs of concept instances have to be created in a unified way, and<br />
should be reused between sites.</p>
<p>This of curse is one of the problems on the Semantic Web, for which no<br />
consensus solution exists.</p>
<p>But as this is one of the important challenges of Semantic Web<br />
adoption on a wide scale, and because SIOC could demonstrate the<br />
potential of the Semantic Web, I would advocate that SIOC be one of<br />
the first Ontologies to provide for a unified naming and sharing<br />
approach.</p>
<p>Other ontology efforts will encounter the same problem sooner or<br />
later, and SIOC could be a precedence here and provide a good example/<br />
best practice.</p>
<p>Possible Solutions:<br />
==========</p>
<p>Currently I can imagine two pragramatic approaches to this problem, as<br />
far as<br />
the wordpress exporter is concerned:</p>
<p>a) ask the user for more information:<br />
- what is the real foaf profile of a blog author, and if he has none,<br />
of some simple links to sites which let the user create one.<br />
- ask comment posters for their foaf profile<br />
- during post creation, check if URIs for the used tags/catgeories/<br />
topics exist, e.g. by asking technorati or a similiar site, and if<br />
none are found, give the user some choices to create good URIs for the<br />
categories</p>
<p>b.) do automatic discovery:<br />
- try to find the foaf file of the user in an autonomic way and then<br />
ask him if the found one is the right one<br />
- try to find URIs for the topics automatically, and ask if they<br />
should be used</p>
<p>(This might surpass the capabilities of wordpress plugins, but they<br />
are non the less first tiny steps to adress this huge and important<br />
problem.)</p>
<p>So to close this: I hope these comments and experiences can be of use<br />
to the SIOC community, and I hope that I did not step on anybodys<br />
toes :)</p>
<p>cheers, Benjamin.</p>

><br />
The main reason is, while post creators are subscribed users of the<br />
platform (i.e. sioc:User), commenters - most of the time, even if some<br />
blog engine allow people to subscribe their blog before posting - are<br />
not registered so are not users as in SIOC, but simply foaf:User.</p>
<p>> That would enable object consolidation for creators of posts: I could<br />

Yet, WP exporter exports both sioc:creator and foaf:maker for the post<br />
writer, so the foaf:maker property would be available for any post /<br />
comment. [1]<br />
And you also have in the sioc:User profile a link to the related<br />
foaf:People.<br />
BTW, the API in the future should allow people to publish comment<br />
using their FOAF URI (in order to link SIOC data to FOAF resources)</p>

<p>Very true, and even if your RDF data store supports such reasoning,<br />
the inverse properties can be quite annoying to implement. Why does<br />
SIOC contain inverse properties? I see no real reason for having them<br />
in SIOC (e.g. no reasoning that would require such inverse<br />
properties). It seems as if they were defined plainly because they<br />
COULD be defined. The usability of the SIOC ontology would be much<br />
greater without them.</p>

I have a simple argument for this - and I know a lot of people believe<br />
inverse properties are not needed and/or cause problems with reasoning<br />
engines -</p>
<p>The Semantic Web is designed for machines first, right? :)  But there's<br />
no need to neglect those poor humans with just a small bit of extra<br />
effort required.</p>
<p>If for example you're talking about a sioc:Comment - and you only had a<br />
reply property that points from Post to reply Posts, then you'd have to<br />
define the Post and the Comment instances...  And even though there are<br />
many nicer formats than RDF/XML to express RDF in, I think RDF/XML still<br />
is the one we see in the main, and it's the one that people see most<br />
often when they view sources...</p>
<p>Now, as someone who has come from a non-core computer science<br />
background, I also think that if you're trying to explain to people who<br />
want to create some SW data that in order to describe that Comment that<br />
they must also define some properties of the Post and Forum and whatever<br />
else is related to it in the opposite direction, they may find that a<br />
bit unwieldy...</p>
<p>But that's my opinion - good to hear others...</p>

<p>There is content so I wonder why the SIOC explorer doesn't see it...<br />
e.g. see:</p>
<p>http://www.boards.co.nz/forums/sioc.php?type=post&amp;post_id=3607</p>
<p>There's both sioc:content and rss_content:encoded in this example.</p>

<p>Good idea - actually maybe this could be integrated into the PHP API<br />
which forms the basis for some current and future SIOC exporters.</p>

<p>We could of course add those specific date terms to SIOC, and ones for<br />
times as well, but maybe there's some way of making our exporters use<br />
both dcterms:created and some other vocab (that I'm unaware of) for<br />
expressing date / time by parts.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that comments are not associated with real user<br />

Uldis can explain more.</p>

<p>This is a great reason for reuse of SIOC URIs through things like the<br />
Semantic Radar plugin, or addons for WordPress that allow you to choose<br />
related posts when you're creating a blog post of your own (e.g. by<br />
searching your blogroll and anything with an XFN attribute (so that<br />
you're not just getting interesting sites)) to provide related posts<br />
that could then be linked from your own.</p>

<p>It's a pity that the Plink service is gone, as that could have been a<br />

other ideas as to how this could be done.</p>

<p>Cool. I will try to use the sioc data from there.</p>
<p>But what I meant can be seen here:</p>
<p>this is a post from a SIOC forum:<br />
http://sioc-project.org/node/241</p>
<p>and its SIOC output has no content:<br />
http://sioc-project.org/sioc/node/241</p>
<p>But I now realize my mistake, that is actually the output of the<br />
drupal sioc exporter,<br />
I guess. So that could be improved a little bit.</p>

What I've been thinking would be nice (though I'm a bit hazy on the<br />
details) is an openID service that when you signup, lets you specify a<br />
FOAF profile (or create one with a FOAF-matic style form), and the page<br />
at your openID uri would contain that data. Then when you create a new<br />
account on another openID-enabled web site, the openID service would use<br />
that request to add a new foaf:holdsAccount property to the RDF on your<br />
openid page.</p>
<p>What would be even nicer would be if (some, at least) web apps published<br />
(at some level), in RDF, the content created by each user at their<br />
profile page on the web app. So if you went to my del.icio.us page for<br />
instance, there would be a link to an RDF representation of all my<br />
bookmarks and tags.</p>
<p>With that in place, web apps could use your openid uri as a bridge to<br />
read the data you've already created at other web apps, and provide you<br />
with a more 'connected' and personalised experience.</p>
<p>My understanding of openID is pretty superficial - I'm not sure if there<br />
is currently a way for the openID service to know that a new account is<br />
being created, if that operation was successful, and  what the uri of<br />
the new account profile would be (I suspect not).</p>
<p>At any rate, the simple act of publishing, or linking to a FOAF profile,<br />
at an openid uri is possible, and would  help  produce  more useful SIOC<br />
data.</p>
<p>Are there any services out there already that do something like what I<br />
described above (I wouldn't be surprised, but haven't found any)?</p>
<p>Even an openID uri without any RDF would presumably help?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Keith</p>

<p>Yes, now that I think about it, giving incentives to create a FOAF<br />
profile during the<br />
creation of an open ID account would solve two problems with one<br />
action.</p>
<p>a.) the user gets one "identity" to use across all the sites that<br />
support open ID<br />
who benefits: the user</p>
<p>b.) the user ties his "identity" directly to some reusable and machine<br />
readable information, about him, which has been filled with data that<br />
he himself chooses (and not some corporation)<br />
who benefits:<br />
the semantic web (data about one user stored in one location with one<br />
URI)<br />
the user (he chooses which data to reveal about himself)</p>
<p>Sadly, I currently know nothing about</p>
<p>- how to tie an open ID "Profile/Identity" to a FOAF profile<br />
- how to tie a FOAF profile to an open ID identity</p>
<p>can anybody offer some quick hints as to how this could be done?</p>

<p>I came across this post<br />
http://danbri.org/words/2007/01/26/161<br />
about this site<br />
http://doxory.com/<br />
which apparently looks for foaf at your openid uri to see what friends<br />
you've got.</p>
<p>For</p>
<p>how to tie an open ID "Profile/Identity" to a FOAF profile</p>
<p>see<br />
http://lists.foaf-project.org/pipermail/foaf-dev/2007-February/008457.html</p>
<p>For how to tie a FOAF profile to an open ID identity,</p>
<p>Henry Story at<br />
http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/openid_for_blogs_sun_com says:</p>
<p>><br />

<p>My guess is that, since most of them aren't looking for it, there isn't<br />
an established standard way to make your foaf discoverable to openid<br />
consumers - you could bung the rdf/xml in with the html, have a  &lt;*link<br />
rel*="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="*FOAF*" href="[url]" /> in<br />
the head, or a grddl or eRDF profile, or maybe conneg?</p>
<p>Perhaps someone else knows?</p>

      <p>Hi Benjamin,</p>
<p>Really a good work :)</p>
<p>I like the feeling of using it.</p>
<p>Just a quick idea: why not adding a filter on the front page to filter<br />
the publishing time (last hour, last day, last month). Could be use as a<br />
sort of blog aggregation.</p>
<p>Also, in comments, it would be interesting to be able to click on<br />
commenters' name to see what other comments they wrote on the blog/other<br />
blogs.</p>
<p>Just some quick thoughts, keep-up the good work!</p>
<p>Take care,</p>

<p>Good idea, thank you. I will think about adding this, when doing the<br />
next changes.</p>
<p>There probably will also be a manual or automatic updating of the<br />
blogs/forums in the<br />
database.</p>

<p>Yes, that one is pretty obvious. Should be coming soon.  :)</p>

Also, I noticed the commenter's name often occurs multiple times. I can<br />
