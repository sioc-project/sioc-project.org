    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Could you please comment on this question:<br />
what should sioc:Post point to as its creator ?</p>
<p>There are two main alternatives: (a) sioc:has_creator -> sioc:User; (b)<br />
foaf:maker -> foaf:Person</p>
<p>Initially (and before usage of foaf:Person was added to SIOC) the<br />
option (a) was intended. This can be observed in the RDF data [1]<br />
generated by WordPress SIOC plugin. This option allows to keep the<br />
information on which user account created the content.</p>
<p>If we do not link from sioc:Post to sioc:User then the user concept<br />
does not become unneeded as such, but it is not used much either - as<br />
nothing would then link to it apart foaf:Person via foaf:holdsAccount.<br />
And we would loose the information that the content was created by a<br />
particular account.</p>
<p>What do you think - is sioc:User useful and should we keep the<br />
information on which account created a Post? For simple use of content<br />
of sioc:Post that is not important but if you tried to import SIOC<br />
content into an CMS (e.g., to make an RDF mirror of a community site)<br />
then this info could be important.</p>
<p>Option (b) is illustrated by RSS export of Morten's blog [2].</p>
<p>There are more ways to point to a creator as well, e.g. use dc:creator<br />
and point it to a rdf:resource as seen on Norm Walsh's blog [3].</p>
<p>We can also use both - point to a foaf:Person and a sioc:User. In<br />
theory if we define the properties inbetween as IFPs then we can always<br />
find foaf:Person if we know the sioc:User. Then the answer would be<br />
(a).</p>
<p>(Hmmm, foaf:holdsAccount is not an IFP).</p>

      <p>Hi,</p>
<p>One reason to keep sioc:User is that screen names are associated with<br />
accounts, not people, and users frequently refer to each other using<br />
their screen names. For example, if a SIOC reader can't access the<br />
screen name, it might render the following:</p>
<p>Jane Doe: True. So does it support Bluetooth?<br />
Mike Smith: Hi! I was wondering whether this forum has a threaded view?<br />
Ann Johnson: @coolbird: Yes! And we're proud of it! ;-)</p>
<p>while with access to the screen name, it could render the same conversation as:</p>
<p>coolbird: True. So does it support Bluetooth?<br />
MSmith: Hi! I was wondering whether this forum has a threaded view?<br />
ann_at_ericsson: @coolbird: Yes! And we're proud of it! ;-)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>On the other hand, it would seem clearer to me to rename sioc:User -><br />
sioc:UserAccount and sioc:has_creator to sioc:creator_account or some<br />
such. Just to keep people from getting too many misconceptions. :-)</p>

      <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Just some thoughts because I have to go:</p>
<p>- For example, Some people will create an account on a forum, but<br />
will not give real personal info (don't need to be related with the<br />
account, a sort of anonymity).</p>
<p>- A single person can have different user accounts depending of the<br />
service/community they use.</p>
<p>- I could care about content generated by a specific Person (foaf) in<br />
a specific onliny community, and not about what he generated on other<br />
online communities; in that case I would refer to his user account,<br />
and not him personally.</p>
<p>Dunno if what I wrote make sense semantically, but quickly, I think<br />
it makes sense to continue with the current method: sioc:User point-<br />
to foaf:Person and foaf:Person point-to sioc:User (via foaf:<br />
HoldAccounts).</p>
<p>I'll come back on the subject tomorrow if something else pop-up in my<br />
mind.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>
<p>Salutations,</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I also think it makes sense to keep sioc:User , as we indeed must make<br />
a distinction between the people and his account(s) on different<br />
forums/blogs. So keeping</p>
<p>sioc:User rdfs:subClassOf foaf:OnlineAccount</p>
<p>seems good, even it UserAccount would be more appropriate to make a<br />
distinction between the user (people) and its account.</p>
<p>BTW, we currently use sioc:name as a subproperty of foaf:name to<br />
define the nick/account name of a user. I think we should subclass it<br />
from foaf:accountName instead.</p>
<p>Regarding the link between post and a user, we've got the choice between:<br />
(a) sioc:Post sioc:has_creator sioc:User / UserAccount<br />
(b) sioc:Post foaf:maker -> foaf:Person</p>
<p>As Richard already mentionned [1], (b) seems to be the current foaf /<br />
dc way to do.</p>
<p>Yet, if we keep (a) we could easilly get (b) with a rule as<br />
_post sioc:has_creator _x<br />
_x rdf:type sioc:User<br />
_y rdf:type foaf:Person<br />
_y foaf:holdsAccount _x<br />
=><br />
_post foaf:maker _y</p>
<p>And we also keep a trace of which account have been involved in the<br />
post / comment (which might be useful when dealing with online<br />
commnities on some social aspect of them)<br />
So I think (a) is more in the SIOC way, and do not interfer with<br />
dc/foaf as we can infer the foaf:maker relationship.</p>
<p>Finally, a bit off topic, I've noticed that some exporters use</p>
<p><sioc:has_creator sioc:email_sha1="..." rdfs:label="..."></sioc:has_creator></p>
<p>especially for comments. I think using sioc:name would be better than<br />
rdfs:label there.</p>
<p>Alex.</p>

<p>You're right, we can use both in exporters.</p>
<p>BTW, we  recently discussed on IRC how to manage people blog repliers<br />
(and, more generally, different kind of post writers).<br />
There are 2 uses cases:<br />
- People need to register, in this case, we'll use the same as for "real" Users<br />
- People just leave an email + a 'name' to post a comment</p>
<p>In this second use case, I don't think we should use sioc:User (and<br />
its properties) as replier is not a *registered* user, which seems to<br />
be the semantic of the User class.<br />
I suggest we only use foaf:Person for them, with properties:<br />
- mbox_sha1sum (to eventually smush data between different blogs /<br />
accounts / people)<br />
- foaf:name, foaf:nick or rdf:label. I'd prefer foaf:nick but as we<br />
can't guess if that's a real name or a name, maye rdf:label is better<br />
? (or maybe foaf allows a nick to be a real name ?)</p>
<p>So,  for registered user who post / comment:<br />
_post sioc:has_creator _user<br />
_post foaf:maker _people<br />
_user rdf:type sioc:User<br />
_people rdf:type foaf:Person<br />
_people foaf:holdsAccount  _user<br />
+ personal information in foaf:Person instance (and we could also keep<br />
sioc:sha1sum in User class)</p>
<p>for unregistered<br />
_post foaf:maker _people<br />
_people rdf:type foaf:Person<br />
+ personnal information in the foaf:Person instance</p>
<p>In the 1st case, both User and People could have a URI, while in the<br />
second case, I think it will be easier to use blank nodes, and them<br />
smush using sha1 (and we can also use it with really anonymous users,<br />
if some forums / blogs / ... allow it)</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
- http://apassant.net/blog/sioc.php?type=post&amp;id=104 (post from registered user)<br />
- http://apassant.net/blog/sioc.php?type=user&amp;id=alex (user<br />
information, with both FOAF and SIOC information). Regarding this, we<br />
should also link to external foaf profile if available<br />
- http://apassant.net/blog/sioc.php?type=comment&amp;id=6709 (unregistered user)</p>
<p>open question:<br />
- will we keep sioc:name + subclass/sameAs from foaf:accountName or<br />
directly use foaf:accountName (+ deprecate sioc:name)<br />
- what about foaf:name / nick / rdfs:label</p>

<p>1) Use foaf:Document instead of a dc:Document. (I did not even find a<br />
dc:Document, is there such a class? If so why does foaf:Document not<br />
subclass from it?)</p>
<p>2) In some places you use an RDF/XML shortcut that results in object<br />
properties having a literal value. E.g., foaf:homepage in the example<br />
below becomes a literal (if I am not mistaken):</p>
<p><foaf:maker foaf:nick="Richard Cyganiak"<br />

<p>You're right and I certainly make the mistake in other shortcuts, I'll<br />

<p>As we discussed on #sioc it is not consistent then - in order to<br />
retrieve information about creator of a post you may have to go 2<br />
different ways. Also, a comment in SIOC is just a Post all this can<br />
apply to posts in general.</p>
<p>I do not know how to solve this.</p>
<p>Option A: a pragmatical approach would be go via sioc:User anyway:</p>
<p><sioc:has_creator><br />
    <sioc:User><br />
         <sioc:account_of><br />
              <foaf:Person><br />
                    ... person's properties ...</foaf:person></sioc:account_of></sioc:user></sioc:has_creator></p>
<p>But it can be argued that this is redundant if we don't know anything<br />
about a user. Also - if we describe comments this way each new comment<br />
will result in a new blank node of a type sioc:User.</p>
<p>We can also define a rule (as suggested by [GNU]) that such a chain<br />
(Post--has_creator--> User --account_of-->Person) means that<br />
Post--foaf:maker-->Person.</p>
<p>Option B: identify a user with what we know</p>
<p>We have sioc:email and sioc:email_sha1 properties in SIOC. In most<br />
cases we would use foaf:mbox of a foaf:Person, but we decided to keep<br />
these properties in SIOC to be able to directly associate a mailbox<br />
with a sioc:User. Then we can say:</p>
<p><sioc:has_creator><br />
    <sioc:User><br />
         <sioc:email rdf:resource="..."/><br />
         ....</sioc:email></sioc:user></sioc:has_creator></p>
<p>But this leaves a FOAF person out of the picture.<br />
This may also require to define sioc:email as an IFP (inverse<br />
functional property).</p>
<p>Option C:</p>
<p>Do as Alex says - use only foaf:maker if the user is not registered in<br />
the system. Objection or suggestion - if we use this pattern and want<br />
to be consistent we should use a foaf:maker for all posts.</p>
<p>> So,  for registered user who post / comment:<br />
> _post sioc:has_creator _user<br />
> _post foaf:maker _people<br />
> _user rdf:type sioc:User<br />
> _people rdf:type foaf:Person<br />
> _people foaf:holdsAccount  _user<br />
> + personal information in foaf:Person instance (and we could also keep<br />

><br />

<p>This is nice - you do use foaf:maker for all posts. :)<br />
This looks like the best solution to me.</p>
<p>> In the 1st case, both User and People could have a URI, while in the<br />

<p>Imagine a person using his FOAF file to identify him/her when writing a<br />
comment... That'd be interesting. :)))</p>
<p>> open question:<br />
> - will we keep sioc:name + subclass/sameAs from foaf:accountName or<br />
> directly use foaf:accountName (+ deprecate sioc:name)<br />
> - what about foaf:name / nick / rdfs:label</p>
<p>If we want to describe a login / account name of a sioc:User (subclass<br />
of foaf:OnlineAccount) then we can use foaf:accountName directly. It is<br />
often used together with a foaf:accountServiceHomepage to indicate the<br />
site that the account is on (although in SIOC we should be able to find<br />
this out from a sioc:Site)</p>
<p>Re. sioc:name - it is not needed for sioc:User then.<br />
But it is needed to give a name to a Usergroup (and its scope should<br />
also be extended to allow to name a Role).</p>
<p>Re. foaf:name / nick / rdfs:label - if we use a foaf:Person to describe<br />
a creator of a comment we should probably use something more meaningful<br />
than rdfs:label. Question - foaf:name or foaf:nick ?</p>

<p>Actually, I think it might be a good idea to leave the FOAF person out<br />
of the picture and *not* making sioc:email an IFP, in this use case.<br />
If people comment without registration, you really have no knowledge<br />
at all about whether the information they provide is correct, so it<br />
might be best not to smush this information too naïvely...</p>
<p>Oh, come to think of it, sioc:email can't be an IFP anyway. sioc:Users<br />
are associated with specific sites, and you can hardly require people<br />
not to use the same e-mail for accounts on different sites ;-)</p>

<p>Agree that sioc:email should not be an IFP.</p>
<p>But just using a sioc:User (leaving or not a foaf:Person out) would<br />
assert that the author of this post/comment has an online account on<br />
this side. Which is a lie.</p>
<p>Shall we end up adding a sioc:Person to the ontology saying "similar as<br />
foaf:Person but you better don't trust this information as you don't<br />
know where it's come from"? Don't think so.</p>
<p>It boils down to the Semantic Web and trust, a generic problem. That is<br />
true with all semantic web data out there - unless it is signed by<br />
someone whom you trust (either directly or via web of trust) you should<br />
not assume that this information is correct.</p>
<p>Maybe we can find/create a property (presumably outside SIOC) that says<br />
"indentified by method X" or "identity assured by ..." in cases when a<br />
User or a foaf:Person is identified on a system...</p>

<p>Ok. Of course, if User is defined that way, your first option doesn't<br />
work either -- only the third one would.</p>

<p>Ok, I'd like to reply to that, but before I do that, I should say that<br />
I think you're probably right that it doesn't make sense to do<br />
anything about this w.r.t. this use case ;-)</p>
<p>Given that, this is slightly off-topic, so I'll keep my reply brief :-)</p>
<p>I agree that this is a general problem with the semantic web.</p>
<p>I don't agree that requiring signatures is necessary for all but<br />
really sensitive decisions: For most stuff, knowing which URI you got<br />
some triples from should be sufficient. E.g., if I get some<br />
information about you from your FOAF file at captsolo.net, for most<br />
purposes I'll trust that it really came from you :-)</p>
<p>This model can be used with most RDF data today. Many RDF data stores<br />
even allow aggregators to store which URI they got a triple from. We<br />
haven't yet figured out how to make applications that practical use of<br />
this, uh, provenance information is the academic term, but we get the<br />
information from the data producers' side, so we are *able* to<br />
experiment on the consumer side.</p>
<p>But if you have information originally asserted by *different* users,<br />
and the only way your site exports it is collected together in one big<br />
RDF graph, things get ugly.</p>
<p>Ideally, a SIOC graph should only assert things that your site<br />
actually knows to be true. (Well, modulo perhaps some practicalities<br />
like you don't *really* know whether one of your users isn't using<br />
their e-mail account together with their spouse, which means foaf:mbox<br />
is not true :-/)</p>
<p>For example, your site can assert as true:</p>
<p>* that there's a user account X in its system<br />
* that a post Y has been posted using account X<br />
* that it has sent a confirmation e-mail for X to e-mail address Z,<br />
making it reasonably certain that (X foaf:mbox Z)</p>
<p>On the other hand, it doesn't know whether it's really true that--</p>
<p>* that the name of the person posting as X is really "Billy Gates"<br />
* that a comment was really posted by the owner of the unverified<br />
e-mail address A that the poster entered</p>
<p>On the gripping hand, it *can* assert that--</p>
<p>* the account holder of X claims that their name is "Billy Gates"<br />
* the poster of the comment claims that their e-mail address is A</p>
<p>But since we can't verify the foaf:names for accounts, and we do *not*<br />
want to define a new 'sioc:account_holder_claims_to_be_called'<br />
property, we don't really have a way to solve this in SIOC anyway --<br />
so it doesn't add that much of a problem that we can't do it for<br />
non-registered users' comments, either.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Hm, I did write the above a bit more detailed than I intended, since<br />
while writing it, I *did* have an idea how it could be solved. It may<br />
be a bad idea, I'm not sure, but I figured I'd put it out there and<br />
get your guys' opinions rather than not mentioning it at all :-)</p>
<p>Here goes: How about putting everything that your system cannot assert<br />
into a separate RDF graph, and then pointing to it through<br />
rdfs:seeAlso?</p>
<p>Give each registered user account a URI; let's say mine is<br />
<users/benja>. Now, you can assert in your main SIOC file:</users/benja></p>
<p>_:post sioc:creator <users/benja>.<br />
<users/benja> foaf:accountName "befallen".   # that's the user name my<br />
university's network assigned me =)<br />
<users/benja> foaf:accountOf [ foaf:mbox <mailto:benja.fallenstein@gmail.com> ].<br />
<users/benja> rdfs:seeAlso <users/benja/foaf.rdf>.</users/benja/foaf.rdf></users/benja></mailto:benja.fallenstein@gmail.com></users/benja></users/benja></users/benja></p>
<p>In <users/benja/foaf.rdf>, you have,</users/benja/foaf.rdf></p>
<p><users/benja/foaf.rdf> foaf:maker _:benja.<br />
<users/benja> foaf:accountName "befallen".<br />
<users/benja> foaf:accountOf _:person.<br />
_:benja foaf:mbox <mailto:benja.fallenstein@gmail.com>.<br />
_:benja foaf:name "Benja Fallenstein".</mailto:benja.fallenstein@gmail.com></users/benja></users/benja></users/benja/foaf.rdf></p>
<p>Here, it's appropriate to include information asserted by me, not your<br />
system -- namely, that my name is "Benja Fallenstein" -- because the<br />
whole graph is information asserted by me, not you (even if your<br />
server exports it for me).</p>
<p>This would also give a way to provide the information for comments by<br />
non-registered users -- but it would require a separate RDF graph for<br />
every such comment.</p>
<p>The problem with all this appears to me to be the gazillions of<br />
requests for little RDF files that it would generate, a performance<br />
problem for both server and consumer. :-( Suggestions about that:</p>
<p>* Still provide one big file with everything, but also provide the<br />
smaller files which give you the provenance information, and be clear<br />
that the big file smushes different people's assertions together.</p>
<p>* Have the clients get the information through SPARQL, not as plain RDF/XML.</p>
<p>Opinions?</p>

<p>Actually, in this case, the easiest way might be to not link the Post<br />
to any foaf:maker or sioc:has_creator.<br />
(I first talked about linking to a bnode from one if these types, but<br />
if it has no property at all I'm not sure it makes sense)</p>
<p>Creating Guest type, if really anonymous, won't allow to link it to<br />
foaf:Person (or creating link between 2 blanks nodes without<br />
properties, not really useful).<br />
Moreover, if we want to create this link, we'll have to create a new<br />
property as we won't be able to use holdsAccount, and so, Guest cound<br />
not be a subclass of User.</p>
<p>I'd prefer the 1st approach, a Post with no assigned maker / creator.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only my opinion :)</p>

      <p>Hi Alex &amp; Frederick,</p>
<p>The downside of having no assigned maker/creator is that you can't<br />
tell from this whether the post was posted as "anonymous", or you<br />
simply don't have all the triples...</p>
<p>I don't have a strong opinion on whether this is important enough to<br />

<p>dc:creator points to a creator of a resource, but does not define more<br />
formal semantics. Its value can also be a literal and it often points<br />
to a string with  a name of creator. (that's how i've seen it used in<br />
RSS 1.0).</p>
<p>Maybe there are other differences as well.</p>

<p>Not directly related to the question, but good to keep in mind to<br />
understand this: If I understand correctly, the Dublin Core folks have<br />
resolved that</p>
<p>    _:post dc:creator "Benja".</p>
<p>implies that there is a resource _:x such that</p>
<p>    _:post dc:creator _:x.<br />
    _:x rdfs:label "Benja".</p>
<p>and that the same is true for all other DC properties too (or most --<br />
dunno whether they'd apply that to dc:date, for example...).</p>
<p>- Benja</p>
