    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry - mixed up what should be a URI for sioc:Forum. Was using the<br />
URL of a feed but should use a URL of the blog / web page itself<br />
instead. Fixed now, XSLT is at the same URL [1].</p>
<p>That brings up more questions:</p>
<p>1. What is a sioc:Site in this case and what should be its URI ?</p>
<p>In the case of WordPress SIOC export the sioc:Site gets a URL of the<br />
blog and sioc:Forum gets a synthesized URL. But maybe it should be the<br />
sioc:Forum instead and leave a sioc:Site w/o a URI (or invent one)?</p>
<p>What about sites like LiveJournal? Should a sioc:Site be<br />
http://www.livejournal.com/ ?</p>
<p>2. If an atom:Entry has both atom:id and atom:link which one should<br />
become a URI for sioc:Post?</p>
<p>Most probably it should be the atom:id, but some sites choose<br />
non-resolvable URIs like "urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:02369:31776"<br />
and there are people who say these are a bad thing to have.</p>

Could anyone reply to Q1 re sioc:Site?</p>
<p>It is a generic question - what should we choose as a URI for<br />
sioc:Site? Should we change the way how it is generated by exporters<br />
now? What should be the URI of sioc:Site in the case of multi-blog<br />
systems such as LiveJournal or wordpress.com?</p>

sioc:Community instead." - and - "The distinction between Site and<br />

<p>And in [2] I was asking for suggestions re. URIs to use for weblog<br />
(sioc:Forum) and for users group (sioc:Usergroup): "I would like to use<br />
nicer URLs for these, but can't find good<br />
candidates.</p>
<p>One option would be to use http://blog/sioc/authors for the authors<br />
list.</p>
<p>For the #weblog it might be natural to use the URL of the blog itself,<br />
but this URI is already given to sioc:Site. "</p>

<p>Choosing the URIs is a practical question and it does not seem to be<br />
very popular in responses to SIOC-Dev, but I believe choosing the right<br />
URIs is very important and can have a large impact.</p>

<p>The sioc:Site should be the domain name (without subdomains) of the web site<br />
hosting the community.</p>
<p>the URI for LiveJournal's sioc:Site would be "http://livejournal.com", etc.</p>
<p>That way:</p>
<p>sioc:Site: "http://www.livejournal.com"<br />
sioc:Forum: "http://a_user.livejournal.com"<br />
sioc:Post: "http://a_user.livejournal.com/some_post"</p>
<p>no?</p>

<p>It could seems useless, however in my opinion it is really important.</p>
<p>By example, what if I try to find all forums (users) on livejournal.com know by<br />
an hypothetic triple store?</p>
<p>I could certainly write something like: </p>
<p>(in this example I consider that the URI of a forum is resolvable, so I'll not<br />
use the sioc:link property)</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>SPARQL<br />
PREFIX sioc:  <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#><br />
SELECT ?forum<br />
WHERE<br />
{<br />
    ?forum a sioc:Forum.<br />
    FILTER regex(?forum, ".*livejournal\.com.*", "i");<br />
}</http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#></p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>But what about that one:</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>SPARQL<br />
PREFIX sioc:  <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#><br />
SELECT ?forum<br />
WHERE<br />
{<br />
    <http://livejournal.com> a sioc:Site;<br />
                             sioc:host_of ?forum.<br />
    ?forum a sioc:Forum.<br />
}</http://livejournal.com></http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#></p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Which one is faster? Intuitively I would say that the second is much faster.</p>
<p>I think that the layers: sioc:Site, sioc:Forum and sioc:Post are essential for<br />
categorization purposes.</p>
<p>The problem is that this is something that I can't do with sioc:Community.</p>
<p>Why? Because: "A sioc:Community is different from a sioc:Site - a site describes<br />
a single community site while a community can consist of a number of sites and<br />
other resources described in SIOC or other ontologies (e.g., FOAF)."</p>
<p>So more than one source can belong to a sioc:Community. What if I only need<br />
sioc:Forums from a single source (domain)? I am back at my case #1.</p>
<p>Beware, SIOC was initially about online communities, but ultimately it can model<br />
much more than that, and deleting the Site class could make things worse on the<br />
long run.</p>
<p>But it should be discussed.</p>
<p>> Choosing the URIs is a practical question and it does not seem to be<br />
> very popular in responses to SIOC-Dev, but I believe choosing the right<br />

<p>Think too.</p>
<p>This was my two pennies to the discussion,</p>
<p>Take care,</p>

<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>1) What to do if we have only www.something.tld DNS record, but not<br />
something.tld record? I don't think it is a good thing to use http: URIs with<br />
hosts, that doesn't resolve.</p>
<p>2) What to do if www.something.tld is "301 Moved Permantenly" HTTP redirect to<br />
something.tld (like in blogging platform / social network Blogiem.lv I am<br />
developing)? HTTP/1.1 specification about 301 redirect says [1]: "The<br />
requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future<br />
references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned URIs. Clients with<br />
link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references to the<br />
Request-URI to one or more of the new references returned by the server,<br />
where possible". So, IMHO it means that if http://www.blogiem.lv/ is 301<br />
redirect to http://blogiem.lv, we could assume that "http://blogiem.lv"<br />
owl:sameAs "http://blogiem.lv". I am wrong?</p>

      <p>Fred,</p>
<p>For the record, my argument against the Site/Forum distinction was<br />
that it is awkward for *single-forum sites*, such as the typical self-<br />
hosted weblog. What's the forum then and what's the site? Both are<br />

<p>To me, my weblog is a single thing. One resource. But to describe it<br />
properly with SIOC, I need to turn it into up to three resources: a<br />
Forum, a Site, and a Community. Why make such a common scenario so<br />
awkward?</p>
<p>Returning to your post, I think that sioc:Site is unnecessary even<br />
for multi-forum communities, and using sioc:Community instead<br />
addresses all the needs you've presented. More inline.</p>

<p>To summarize, you say that you can't find all the forums on<br />
livejournal.com if livejournal.com is modelled as a sioc:Community,<br />
unless by using ugly and slow FILTER trickery.</p>
<p>How about this:</p>
<p>SELECT ?forum<br />
WHERE {<br />
     <http://livejournal.com/> a sioc:Community;<br />
         sioc:has_part ?forum .<br />
     ?forum a sioc:Forum .<br />
}</http://livejournal.com/></p>
<p>Easy, no?</p>
<p>The only thing you can't do that way is distinguish between single-<br />
site communities and multi-site communities. For that you would<br />
indeed need a FILTER. Do you have a use case where this distinction<br />
matters *and* where the lower performance of FILTER and REGEX would<br />
be a concern?</p>
<p>My main argument against sioc:Site is that it's redundant. You said:</p>
<p>> The sioc:Site should be the domain name (without subdomains) of the<br />

<p>Why duplicate information that is already in the URIs? Why not just<br />
call it sioc:Domain then?</p>
<p>I suppose there is some underlying thing you want to represent with<br />
the sioc:Site, beside just the domain name. What is it?</p>
<p>(Now the term sioc:ForumProvider is floating around in my head ...)</p>

<p>Yeah, I talked about that with Uldis on IRC. The question we had is:<br />
what is the implication of a resources that is defined as a Forum and<br />
a Site. We think there are none, but who know?</p>

<p>You are right. But what if SIOC is used to describe bookmarks in a<br />
bookmarking system? What if SIOC is used to model a repository of<br />
files? What if the communities are not blogs or forums?</p>
<p>This is the question I have, and this is why I don't agree to delete<br />
it too quickly.</p>

<p>Yeah you are right, I made a mistake while reading it the first time.</p>
<p>But what I like with sioc:Site is that a site can host many<br />
communities. You will probably tell me that we can model the same<br />

<p>Why would you want to do that? I think if SIOC lost its focus on the<br />
things that almost all online communities have in common -- people,<br />
forums and posts -- then it would lose much of its appeal. Creating<br />
vocabularies is cheap on the Semantic Web, so you can create new ones<br />
to augment SIOC for specific applications.</p>

<p>No, not the way it is defined right now. A sioc:Site can host forums<br />
and user groups, but not communities. (The documentation states that<br />
a sioc:Site could be "the location of a set of online communities",<br />
but there are no properties to model this. Sigh ...)</p>
<p>> You will probably tell me that we can model the same<br />

<p>Being hosted at the same site doesn't imply being part of the same<br />
community. In fact, it doesn't imply much of anything.</p>

<p>Because sioc:Site duplicates information that is in the URIs (just<br />
extract the second-level domain out of the URI and you have your<br />
site, according to the practice you have proposed). sioc:Community<br />
does not duplicate information that is in the URIs, but provides new<br />
information. That's why I'd rather drop sioc:Site.</p>
<p>> There is a problem with these two classes, but I am wondering if the<br />

<p>Yes, but then you'll have to be prepared to also clarify their names.</p>
<p>And I wonder if this discussion has any point at all. Is it even<br />
possible to change any of these things, given that they are now all<br />
over the documentation and publications and deployed code?</p>

<p>A description can be attached to a sioc:Community instance just fine.<br />
I can't find a property for owner in the SIOC spec. If you need a new<br />
vocabulary for those alleged "many Site properties", then put Site in<br />
that vocabulary.</p>

<p>No, this doesn't mean you need sioc:Site. At best it means you may<br />
need *something else beside sioc:Community*. (I mentioned<br />
sioc:ForumProvider earlier.)</p>

      <p>Hi Richard -</p>
<p>I'll answer your points below, but in short, it's impossible to make<br />
an ontology that suits everyone's sensibilities.  I also have problems<br />
with some of our terms, but sometimes you can only do what is good<br />
enough.  That doesn't mean that anything in SIOC is there forever; if<br />
people aren't using Site, that's a good enough reason as any to<br />
deprecate it.</p>

<p>Without being bitchy, we have a Role property that I allege can be<br />
used for describing ownership.  I'm not saying the Site properties<br />
have to be found in the SIOC vocabulary alone...</p>
<p>> No, this doesn't mean you need sioc:Site. At best it means you may<br />

<p>Provider, Site, Host, there's lots of names you could choose.  We<br />
chose Site.  Maybe not the most unique name and annoying for those who<br />
think a site is just a URI, but it allows us to describe the host of a<br />
forum / blog / mailing list archive in a way that I think is needed in<br />
SIOC.</p>
<p>> You don't need sioc:Site when it just mirrors the fact that multiple<br />

<p>I run a number of forum and blog hosting sites.  I have a need for<br />
more than the URL of the host at least.  I also think we need a<br />
has_subsite property to further classify sites and their subsections.<br />
I know the blogger/blogspot example given earlier on the list might be<br />
an unusual case, but I'd prefer to at least be able to cater for such<br />
possibilities.</p>
<p>> (And, I could ask, if there is no community, then how can it be in<br />

<p>Hehe!  Because you can still talk about multiple communities and where<br />
they are (on one site for example).  And, there are many sites with<br />
communities that could be related (i.e. on the same site) - exposing<br />
such information could create new links between these communities<br />
(e.g. ezboard, Wordpress.com, etc.)  FOAF talks about other things<br />
than just the friends themselves, no reason SIOC can't either.</p>
<p>To answer the "how do you say that a site hosts a community" question<br />
you posed earlier, I think you can use part_of (if the community only<br />
has one part that is a site, then the site = the community).</p>
<p>A worthwhile discussion though, I'd like more input from others...</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Together with what you said earlier in this thread, a self-hosted<br />
weblog that is also a community (a very common case I think) would be<br />
described like this:</p>
<p><http://my-weblog.com/><br />
     a sioc:Community;<br />
     a sioc:Site;<br />
     a sioc:Forum;<br />
     sioc:has_part <http://my-weblog.com/>;<br />
     sioc:has_host <http://my-weblog.com/>;</http://my-weblog.com/></http://my-weblog.com/></http://my-weblog.com/></p>
<p>I don't think that's an elegant solution, and would really like<br />
something better. But I prefer it to using three distinct resources<br />
for the one weblog.</p>

<p>I didn't say that it was better that way, I said "sometimes you can only<br />
do what is good enough" - take care paraphrasing!  Again, there is<br />
always room for improvement, but I haven't been convinced of a need to<br />
drop sioc:Site.</p>
<p> > I don't see how you can attach a Role to a sioc:Site without<br />

<p>I think the domain and range were removed some time ago to allow just this.</p>
<p> > Ok, you think it's needed, I got that. But what for?<br />
...<br />
 > What for do you need it?</p>
<p>I have a blogging site called journals.ie.  Within that there are many<br />
hosted blogs (which may be just sioc:Forums), but also a forums area for<br />
bloggers to talk in.  So there's a site journals.ie that hosts blogs.<br />
There's another part of that site (journals.ie Forums) that contains<br />
forums.  I need to be able to say that the main site is powered by<br />
WordPress MU, that the forum subsite is powered by bbPress, that maybe<br />
they are hosted at the same domain and are related but they are also<br />
different systems.  I also don't need to repeat for the hundreds of<br />
hosted blogs that they are powered by WordPress if the site they are<br />
hosted on is powered by WordPress.</p>
<p>For my bulletin board sites, I need to say that they are powered by<br />
vBulletin or phpBB without repeating it each time for each forum.  I<br />
want to be able to say who to contact, a copyright blurb, what kind of<br />
registration is required, what are related sites, what time zone is it<br />
in, how many posts does it contain (without aggregating every forum and<br />
thread), etc.  It's true that some of these alleged "many Site<br />
properties" may be in another vocabulary or may not exist yet, but they<br />
can be added later...</p>
<p> >> I also think we need a has_subsite property to further classify<br />
sites and their subsections.<br />
 > What for do you think it is needed?</p>
<p>Here's an example of a Site with subsites.  Site http://free.boards.jp<br />
with 50 hosted subsites.  Subsite example<br />
http://free.boards.jp/index.php?mforum=jpopforums and forums on that<br />
subsite include<br />
http://free.boards.jp/viewforum.php?f=17&amp;mforum=jpopforums etc.  The<br />
structure of this isn't obvious from the URLs alone, since the subsites<br />
are constructed via a parameter.</p>

<p>It is inelegant, but also I think you are creating a new notion of a<br />
community to be associated with your blog.  It's not just the blog, but<br />
it's the users who read and comment on your blog, the blogroll or<br />
trackback links in to and out of your site.  Perhaps it deserves its own<br />
URI?</p>
<p>As for when the Site and the Forum are one and the same thing, I'd<br />
suggest that we need to discuss whether Site needs to be used at all in<br />
such cases.</p>
<p>I have to end my reasons here, crazy few days ahead...  Happy Christmas all!</p>

<p>Not every blog has a community centered on it (mine certainly not),<br />
but many do. I don't think one should introduce new URIs for things<br />
that exist purely on the web just for the purpose of being able to<br />
talk about them in RDF. I'm quite ok with having both sioc:Community<br />
and sioc:Forum as types here, both add much to a consumer's<br />
understanding of what the URI represents.</p>
<p>> As for when the Site and the Forum are one and the same thing, I'd<br />

<p>Yes, good question. Maybe my complaint can be boiled down to this:</p>
<p>While sioc:Site is essential for modelling complex sites, it doesn't<br />
add much value for simple cases like self-hosted weblogs. Simply not<br />
using sioc:Site in such cases seems odd -- after all, a self-hosted<br />
weblog still *is* a web site.</p>
<p>So maybe the question is: What does a forum at http://www.boards.jp<br />
have that http://dowhatimean.net doesn't have? The answer is not "a<br />
site" -- probably more something like "a hosting organization" or "a<br />
service provider". So, maybe we should relabel sioc:Site?</p>
<p>> I have to end my reasons here, crazy few days ahead...  Happy<br />

<p>Thanks, and happy holidays to you too.</p>

<p>Well, not always sioc:Forum has the same domain as sioc:Site. For example, in<br />
blogging system I am developing, Blogiem.lv, by default user blogs have host<br />
myblog.blogiem.lv, but they can assign TLD or any other DNS hostnames to<br />
their blogs. So we can have "something.com" hosted on "blogiem.lv". So,<br />
actually we have two different resources - a community "blogiem.lv" and a<br />
hosting site "blogiem.lv". But we can't have identical URIs for two different<br />
resources, of course. The same applies for Wordpress.com, AFAIK.</p>
<p>SIOC specification says [1] that sioc:Site is "The location of an online<br />
community or set of communities, with Users and Groups creating Posts on a<br />
set of Forums.", so, as I understand that, Site is physical hoster of a<br />
sioc:Forum, and has nothing to do with DNS names.</p>
<p>sioc:Community is [2] "a top level concept that defines an online community<br />
and what it consists of."</p>
<p>Interesting case also is Blogger, where you should always have<br />
sioc:Community "blogger.com", but sioc:Site can be "blogspot.com"<br />
or "myserver.com", where sioc:Forum can be "something.blogspot.com"<br />
or "something.myserver.com" or even "something.com" (with<br />
sioc:Site "myserver.com", if it hosts that Forum), because it provides you an<br />
option to upload generated blog content via FTP/SFTP to another webserver.</p>
