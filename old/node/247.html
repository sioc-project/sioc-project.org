    <p>Hi Sergio,</p>
<p>That's interesting. Mind elaborating why you did this? Or do you have<br />
a link to an explanation?</p>
<p>I'm interested because when using SIOC for IRC logs, we had to figure<br />
out how to order IRC events that come in the same second; we hacked it<br />
by using the millisecond part of dcterms:created to contain a counter,<br />
so that you'd have the event at 12:03:01 followed by the event at<br />
"12:03:01.001" followed by the event at "12:03:01.002".</p>
<p>Would you consider changing the definition of swaml:previousByDate and<br />

<p>I'm wondering how it would work if the same message is in more than<br />

<p>In mailing lists always is interesting to know the chronological order<br />
of the messages posted. Classic syntactic exporters (such as pipermail)<br />
already provide long ago this feature.</p>

<p>For a mailing list it's much more simple, because it's the mailing list<br />
manager who has made that work. Then we suppose that the messages will<br />
go correctly ordered into the mbox file.</p>

<p>Sure, but I think that it's already enough generic (both properties have<br />
sioc:Post as rdfs:domain and rdfs:range) if we ignore the comment.<br />
Perhaps we could make more generic those descriptions.</p>

<p>Interesting question... now SWAML'll give two different URIs for same<br />
message posted in two different mailing lists. It is left much work to<br />
do...</p>

<p>Should we include these properties in the SIOC ontology then? If they<br />
apply to different types of sioc:Post(s) then it would make sense.</p>
<p>The only question / problem, which applies to any "linked list"<br />
ordering in general is what happens when data changes - e.g. - what<br />
will happen if you remove one of the messages in this chain?</p>
<p>(a) if you remove a message from the mailing list itself, regenerate<br />
RDF data and put that data in a store that also contains the old<br />
information, you may end up with confusing information - a message<br />
pointing to two different messages as nextByDate. (maybe it's a<br />
non-problem, who knows.)</p>
<p>(b) if you delete information about this message only from the RDF<br />
store, that may break the "next/previous" chain.</p>
<p>Probably these properties are best not included in the original<br />
"dynamic" data, but being created using rules by some application<br />
along the data conversion chain. Such an application would look at the<br />
original "hard" evidence (e.g., date order in dct:created) and<br />
generate next/previous thread information.</p>

<p>Makes practical sense. These messages may also get different reply<br />
threads in different mailing lists (depends if all mailing lists are<br />
copied in the reply), etc. But it can also be interesting to see how<br />
to express the fact that this is the same message (in different<br />
mailing lists). Do you currently do that somehow?</p>

<p>Maybe you can prove me wrong, but in this scenario, I think the same<br />
thing would happen to the "has_reply/reply_of" chain, so actually the<br />
addition of "next_by_date/previous_by_date" properties doesn't introduce<br />
a new issue in the ontology.</p>
<p>By the way, from my point of view, "next/previous" shouldn't be declared<br />
as a transitive property. In fact, if there was a need to have<br />
transitive properties for temporal relationships (I think there isn't),<br />
my proposal would be to call them "follows/precedes".</p>

<p>That's a good point, and SWAML isn't addressing this issue at the<br />
moment. At a first glance, I believe cross-posted messages must have the<br />
same identity (i.e.: they must be the same instance, or have an<br />
owl:sameAs relationship). However, I recognize that the problem requires<br />
a deeper study.</p>

<p>True, it's a generic issue (or non-issue).<br />
Alexandre proposed transitive properties as a potential solution.</p>

<p>Could you discuss with Alexandre the motivation for / against<br />
transitivity. If there are doubts it is better to leave it out and add<br />
at a later stage, if needed.</p>
<p>One reason against transitivity is the literal meaning of<br />
"next_by_date" - as only one item can be _the_next_ item after the<br />
current one. Is there enough motivation for transitivity to make a<br />
name / meaning change to follows[_by_date] / precedes[_by_date] ?</p>

<p>We thought about this in SIOC before, but at the moment I can't recall<br />
what was the idea.</p>
<p>owl:sameAs seems a bit too strict as a person might reply to the<br />
message in one mailing list without replying to it in the other list<br />
where the original message was cross-posted. Then you may want to add<br />
a sioc:has_reply relationship only to one of these instances of the<br />
original message (if you wish to be precise).</p>

<p>In addition to this reason, I'd like to propose another one: computing<br />
if a Post "follows_by_date" another Post can be done in O(1) time by<br />
simply comparing the date of the Posts, so it is really cheap. However,<br />
adding a transitive relationship to make explicit this information<br />
requires to add O(n^2) triples, where "n" is the number of Posts. Even<br />
if most of these triples are inferred by a reasoner, this is a huge<br />
amount of memory!</p>
<p>On the other hand, given a collection of Posts without "next_by_date"<br />
relationships, computing if a Post is the "next_by_date" of another one<br />
requires O(n) time, because you have to check that no other Post was<br />
posted between the other ones (Of course, this would be cheaper if Posts<br />
were sorted, but this is not the case in RDF stores). At the same,<br />
adding a non-transitive "next_by_date" relationship requires just O(n)<br />
triples, which is an affordable amount of memory in order to make this<br />
query time-efficient.</p>

<p>In my opinion, such precission isn't required in most scenarios. The<br />
important information here is that you are replying to a message.<br />
Furthermore, both messages (the original one and the reply) will have<br />
links to the Forums they were posted to.</p>
<p>Regarding this, if we share the same instance of Post for the copies of<br />
a cross-posted message in several Forums, then<br />
"next_by_date"/"previous_by_date" should not be [inverse] functional<br />
properties, because the same instance would be a member of several<br />
sequences.</p>
<p>As I said before, I still have some doubts about this issue. I don't<br />
like the idea to introduce a new property (say sioc:cross_posted) to<br />
link different instances of Post that are "almost the same, but not<br />
actually the same because they were posted in different Forums".<br />
However, I agree that we should be careful and not to rush into making<br />
them the same instance without being aware of the consequences.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>P.S.: I'm glad to announce that Sergio will report great news for SWAML<br />
as soon as he comes back from Seville ;-)</p>

<p>I mentionned transitivity for nextByDate property because I think that<br />
makes sense since the notion of "by date" involves a chronological<br />
aspect. (so there's a transitivity regarding more recent / older<br />
items). The main advantage is using a reasoner + OWL capabilities when<br />
available, rather than a query with dc:date > xx to find all more<br />
recent mails.<br />
Yet, indeed, that's not that much useful, but I think that's cleaner.</p>
<p>If defining a generic next / previous property (that do not involve<br />
chronological aspect), there is yet no particular reason to use<br />
transitivity (since there can be different semantics in the 'next'<br />
meaning depending the platform / user)</p>
<p>> One reason against transitivity is the literal meaning of<br />

Indeed, if by next_by_date you mention *the* next item, there must be<br />
another name for 'any item after the current one re. date'.<br />
But if transitivity is not needed at the moment, let's use<br />
next_by_date, and we might find a way to deal with it - or not -<br />
later.</p>

<p>Alex.</p>

It can also apply to IRC conversations, instant messaging ...</sergio@wikier.org></captsolo@gmail.com></p>

Actually, I think that defining these properties as transitive (and<br />
also as inverses) would help, at least theorically.</p>

If nextByDate is defined as a transitive property, getting more than<br />
one message related with nextByDate won't be a problem (BTW, in this<br />
case using a store that differentiates original / inferred statements<br />
would help).<br />
The problem is more related to RDF data stores maintenance, since the<br />
"nextByDate post" exists in the store but not in the original souce.<br />
Cannot it be solved by using context / named graphs to add information<br />
in the store ?</p>

<p>Even if they are included in the original data, it shouldn't break<br />
with a reasoner.<br />
Let's say we have<br />
a sioc:nextByDate b<br />
b sioc:nextByDate c<br />
=> a sioc:nextByDate c<br />
Removing b (a sioc:Post) shouldn't break the chain, as we'll still<br />
have a sioc:nextByDate c.<br />
Yet, we must take care of removing both original statements, but I<br />
think a "clean" remove of b from the store can make it (by removing<br />
all properties associated to b)</p>
