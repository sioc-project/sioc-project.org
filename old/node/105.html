  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>To summarise about proposed ontology additions / changes:</p>
<p>= Decided:</p>
<p>1) Add sioc:Community<br />
+ properties sioc:has_part and sioc:part_of pointing to and from it.</p>
<p>We are quite sure that a Community concept is needed.<br />
There can still be some discussion about the property names and alternatives.</p>
<p>= Almost there:</p>
<p>2) sioc:Comment</p>
<p>Initially we thought "let's make all posts generic - comments are same<br />
as posts", but there's a need to distinguish between comments and<br />
posts.</p>
<p>Proposal: create a [ sioc:Comment rdfs:subClassOf sioc:Post . ]</p>
<p>Comment is also a post, but a specific type of. That should solve the problem.</p>
<p>= Need your input:</p>
<p>3) Properties linking Site to Usergroup</p>
<p>We need a property to link sioc:Site to sioc:Usergroup (and inverse of it).</p>
<p>Proposals:<br />
 - sioc:has_base / sioc:base_of<br />
 - sioc:has_group / (name for inverse?)</p>
<p>Former proposed as a neutral name by John, later used in WordPress<br />
exporter but undocumented in the ontology .</p>
<p>4) Property linking Site to Sub-Sites</p>
<p>sioc:Site may consist of a number of different subsites.<br />
How do we express that?</p>
<p>Note: this is needed if a site consists of a number of heterogenous parts.<br />
If a site consists of a number of forums (in a bulletin board) or<br />
blogs (multi-user blog site), there already is a [ sioc:Site<br />
sioc:host_of sioc:Forum . ] construct for that.</p>
<p>5) Subtypes of Forums ?</p>
<p>Same as for Posts/Comments we may want to express / search for a<br />
specific type of [container of sioc:Posts].</p>
<p>Currently such a container is sioc:Forum, which is used to express all<br />
types of community site "containers" - in practice most instance data<br />
describe either blogs or boards/forums.</p>
<p>Proposal: subclasses of sioc:Forum:<br />
 - Blog (Weblog?)<br />
 - MailingList<br />
 - NewsGroup<br />
 - ... (Forum?! / Board / BulletinBoard)</p>
<p>Issue:<br />
 - if we use sioc:Forum for generic container (would be consistent<br />
with existing data), how do we name a particular subclass talking<br />
about a board/forum ?<br />
 - if we call it sioc:Forum (warning! redefining sioc:Forum now is<br />
BAD), how do we can the generic container?</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>That's it. If there are more additions, will write about them in a<br />
separate post. Things planned to write about: threads, roles<br />
(moderator, admin), expressing that a user subscribes to a thread, ...</p>
<p>If there are no objections, I will add points (1) and (2) to the ontology.<br />
For (3), (4) and (5) we need to decide.</p>
<p>They may be described in the issues list, but first I wrote them up<br />
here in the email and let's see - some can be solved quickly and acted<br />
upon, those that require more discussion will be added to IssuesList.<br />
(If you want to add them to the IssuesList now, go ahead and do it!)</p>
<p>Best,<br />

<p>I think this has been agreed on.</p>

<p> > 4) Property linking Site to Sub-Sites</p>
<p>I read the reasons for not having this on the list, and agreed with them<br />
at the time that we could just use sioc:Community.  But the more I<br />
thought about it last night, the more I thought this property might<br />
actually be required.  Let's say that there's a site for Semantic Web at<br />
rdfs.org which has an associated community for SIOC at the subsite or<br />
subsection rdfs.org/sioc.  If we say Community "SW" has_part Site<br />
"rdfs.org", Community "SIOC" has_part "rdfs.org/sioc" and then that<br />
Community "SW" has_part Community "SIOC", then there's nothing to say<br />
that the Site "rdfs.org" and Site "rdfs.org/sioc" are related (since<br />
Community "SW" will probably have other Sites like "planetrdf.com" etc.<br />
But adding the link between the sites further describes what parts of<br />
the community are related to each other...</p>
<p> > 5) Subtypes of Forums ?</p>
<p>Again, can be added to the types module at a later date.</p>
<p> > 6) subscriber_of / has_subscriber</p>
<p>I think this is okay.</p>
<p> > 7) has_sibling -> sibling</p>
<p>Would like this too :)</p>

<p>To be handled in a module, outside the SIOC core ontology.</p>
<p>See also discussion "Using SKOS to describe communication structures".<br />
In general there is not much difference in using RDFS/OWL to extend<br />
sioc:Post (in a separate "types" module) and using SKOS to define the<br />
type hierarchy as Christoph proposed.</p>
<p>SKOS adds another layer to the "onion" though and that may be<br />
redundant.</p>

<p>One option of solving this is to come to a situation where we really<br />
need subsite/supersite properties and can not use existing Site and<br />
Community. Since Community is new and with a very wide scope we should<br />
use it first and maybe not invent new properties where a Community<br />
might fit.</p>
<p>The current use case is somewhat "difficult" and might not be a best<br />
example because in reality rdfs.org is a Site which contains a page<br />
(Post?) about SIOC. This page is also a 'canonical location' or home<br />
page for SIOC, but it is not a SIOC site by itself.</p>
<p>Can we come up with a better use case?</p>
<p>>  > 5) Subtypes of Forums ?<br />
><br />

<p>Agree. Same as #2.</p>
<p>8) Replace sioc:created_at with dc:date ?</p>
<p>And what happens to sioc:modified_at ?<br />
Alternative: subclass both from dc:date. (but does that help in any<br />
way?)</p>

A better use case are multi-forum hosting sites like www.forumwise.com,<br />
which host many subsites containing forums.</p>

<p>Same with *.wordpress.com which hosts many weblogs. In the case of<br />
weblogs though we can say that each weblog is a Forum and the big<br />
multi-blog site is a Site.</p>
<p>Now I am starting to wonder - shall we model multi-(forum/blog/...)<br />
sites as a single Site and multiple Forums (as we intended to do for<br />
multi-weblog sites) or shall each forum/blog be a Site which then<br />
belong to some bigger entity (Site, Community, ...).</p>
<p>One argument is that a Community implies that there is something<br />
keeping these objects (sites, people, ...) together (common interests<br />
or activities). For sites hosting forums/blogs/wikis/... the only thing<br />
they have in common is where they are hosted, but they might not have<br />
any other ties. This is too little to join them in a community.</p>
<p>Still we have to be able to say "This service (Site) contains/hosts (a<br />
list of sites)". This could be used to point to SIOC profiles of<br />
individual forums/weblogs.</p>
<p>P.S. A minimal solution to the use case above is to define the hosting<br />
as a Site which does not have any forums and have rdfs:seeAlso links<br />
form it to individual sites:</p>
<p><sioc:Site rdf:about="#hosting"><br />
   <rdfs:seeAlso><br />
      <sioc:Site rdf:about="http://captsolo.wordpress.com"/><br />

      <p>It's true that some sites may host subsites that may not be related to a<br />
particular community, but also that the opposite my be true (there may<br />
be something like free.boards.jp where all the subsites are related to a<br />
community interested in Japanese culture).  So I think it is good to<br />
have the flexibility of a has_subsite / subsite_of relationship...</p>

      <p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>Thanks for comments. True, expressing relationships as first-class<br />
citizens has to be considered. See this question mentioned in an<br />
earlier SIOC-Dev post [1].</p>
<p>[1]<br />
http://groups.google.com/group/sioc-dev/browse_frm/thread/a9f1247d9bbf71f6/</p>
<p>But when you express properties as objects the result is an explosive<br />
growth of the dataset and it makes queries more complex. It is a<br />
tradeoff between expressivity and complexity and so far we have aimed<br />
at reducing complexity in SIOC ("make it as simple as possible, but not<br />
simpler" :).</p>
<p>There may be cases when relationships as first calls citizens are<br />
desireable or necessary. SIOC shall allow to express (most of) the<br />
information contained within a community site. Hence the question is -<br />
what is the use case for using relationships as first class objects -<br />
what significant information is there that can not be expressed by SIOC<br />
as is now?</p>
<p>What would be your suggestions where it is needed?<br />
And how do you approach this question in your work?</p>

    <h3><a href="105.html#comment-120" class="active">Status  About SIOC concepts / properties</a></h3>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hi Uldis,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for this thoughtful response to my comments.<br />
Actually, we are in violent agreement on the notion that there is this<br />
opportunity for "explosive growth" in the database. At the moment,<br />
using a bit of arm waving, I am willing to set that argument aside<br />
and, as you thoughtfully query, ask what it is that drives the need<br />
for making everything in some universe of discourse a first class<br />
"citizen" (a "subject", in my vernacular).</p>
<p>This will not be the most thoughtful response I can give, since, at<br />
this time, I have a tiny hole in a busy schedule and I'd like to maybe<br />
just tease open the door into my set of arguments I might pose in<br />
favor of my earlier statements.</p>
<p>Consider the simple "concept map" -- an enormously powerful<br />
constructivist tool used everywhere on this planet in education, and<br />
even now in the construction of ontologies. There, you have nodes and<br />
labeled arcs. Nodes, in my vernacular, are first class citizens,<br />
whereas labeled arcs are not the same. Drop a node in as a reification<br />
of that relationship and now you have another subject about which you<br />
can converse. The query is this: under which use cases would you ever<br />
care to converse about relationships?</p>
<p>A knee-jerk response to that question is: "almost always." Which use<br />
case defines "almost always"?  It goes like this. Stan Ulam, one of<br />
the famous mathematicians in the middle of the previous century<br />
(imagine saying that and meaning just a few years back!) was once<br />
asked what he thought about AI (artificial intelligence). His<br />
response, in massive paraphrase, went like this: as soon as they (AI)<br />
figure out how to represent "as" (as in "seeing as"), they will arrive<br />
(whatever that means). We already are good at "isA", but not at "asA".<br />
His story went like this: when we talk about some scene, say, a driver<br />
and passenger cruising past us, we speak of two persons, one *as* a<br />
driver and one *as* a passenger. We are speaking of them in relation<br />
to their "roles".</p>
<p>Now, the ontologists doing OWL have devised two ways to use OWL, one<br />
being the traditional "slot value" approach, and the other being the<br />
"roles" approach. In some problems, they can get away with the<br />
slot-value approach, but in others, they are required to reify the<br />
relationship into a role statement and then use that. That is to say,<br />
they had a situation where a simple triple would not suffice. That<br />
happens when you need to talk about the relationship itself. You need<br />
to say something to the effect that this relationship happened "at<br />
this time", or "on the occasion of" or "was caused by", or something<br />
else. Consider "owl:sameAs". When you think about it, someone invoking<br />
"owl:sameAs" is performing a fiat judgment. Really, "owl:sameAs"<br />
should be reified into an instance onto which one can append reasons<br />
for making the claim. How else will anyone else, not to forget the<br />
computers that interpret the ontologies, be able to explain anything?</p>
<p>The KISS principle is a good one. No argument there. The question<br />
becomes one  that speaks in terms of just where it is that you are<br />
simplifying things. You can get by with the slot-value idea (the nodes<br />
and labeled arcs approach) and that is simple. But, does it always<br />
suffice? I believe not. I also believe that as the nature of complex<br />
situations grow in your networked communities, so will the nature of<br />
the means by which you must represent that complexity. When you say<br />
that X blogged Y, what does X mean? What does Y mean? In what way did<br />
X blog Y? Did X answer a question, argue pro or con about a statement<br />
made by Y? What, indeed, did X actually say? What subject(s) did X<br />
raise in the blog? How are those subjects related to other events?</p>
<p>Gordon Pask launched something called Conversation Theory (makes great<br />
google fodder), in which he spoke about several important concepts.<br />
One concept is the speaker's model of the listener. You don't talk<br />
quantum mechanics to a toddler simply because your model of the<br />
toddler strongly suggests the little snapper won't have a clue what<br />
you are saying. Another is your model of your universe, that from<br />
which you draw as you converse. Another is the listener's model of the<br />
speaker, and, of course, the listener's model of the universe. And<br />
then, there is another concept: entailment meshes.  Everything we say<br />
carries entailments. The punch line of this paragraph entails my<br />
earlier statements.</p>
<p>By that, I am saying (perhaps claiming) that the SIOC charter appears<br />
to entail a need to be ready to model (represent) very complex<br />
situations. I would go so far as to suggest that, if that charter is<br />
taken seriously, then the ability to model really complex situations<br />
is the primary use case. I will then follow with the suggestion that<br />
role modeling will almost always be required if one takes modeling<br />
seriously. That is to say, nodes with labeled arcs probably will not<br />
suffice.</p>
<p>Strongish claims. I know that. The devil makes me say things like<br />
that. Your mileage might vary, but that's how I see the nature of<br />
modeling communities; communities are organisms. Communities respond<br />
to feedback, they experience loss of memory (decay), in short, they<br />
are complex adaptive systems, and they ought to be modeled as such. I<br />
mean no disrespect to the many really great minds who think up ways to<br />
simplify the tools that facilitate human social intercourse, but I<br />
tend to think that the romantic and reductionist passions in us tend<br />
to win out more often than is best for the stated mission. Strongest<br />
claim: nothing short of holistic thinking should be applied to<br />
modeling, representing, and facilitating social intercourse.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Hi ther!</p>
<p>Okay, there are some week-end thoughts as promised.</p>
<p>> 3) Properties linking Site to Usergroup<br />
><br />
> We need a property to link sioc:Site to sioc:Usergroup (and inverse of it).<br />
><br />

<p>It is true that we need such a relation. As I said earlier, I was creating a<br />
sioc:Usergroup for yeah sioc:Forum in Talk Digger. However the relation was<br />
implicit, and it would be nice to explicit it.</p>
<p>Personally I would be willing to implement the sioc:has_group (does<br />
sioc:group_of make sense if we are thinking about sioc:Site as a meta-group?).</p>
<p>I don't think that the term "base" is well suited to describe that relation.</p>
<p>> 1) Add sioc:Community<br />
> + properties sioc:has_part and sioc:part_of pointing to and from it.<br />
><br />

><br />

<p>> 4) Property linking Site to Sub-Sites<br />
><br />
> sioc:Site may consist of a number of different subsites.<br />

><br />
> Note: this is needed if a site consists of a number of heterogenous parts.<br />

> sioc:host_of sioc:Forum . ] construct for that.</p>
<p>Could you remember me what was the "consensus" we had vis-a-vis the<br />
sioc:Community class? In my memory, I thought that it was what you are<br />
proposing with the #4 (A community is the aggregation of many sites of<br />
interests). In that case, a Community is a meta-site and the sioc:Site class is<br />
what you describe as the Sub-Site thing.</p>
<p>> 5) Subtypes of Forums ?<br />
><br />
> Same as for Posts/Comments we may want to express / search for a<br />
> specific type of [container of sioc:Posts].<br />
><br />
> Currently such a container is sioc:Forum, which is used to express all<br />

><br />
> Proposal: subclasses of sioc:Forum:<br />
>  - Blog (Weblog?)<br />
>  - MailingList<br />
>  - NewsGroup<br />
>  - ... (Forum?! / Board / BulletinBoard)</p>
<p>Could be a good idea, however, please tell me if I am wrong, but I think that<br />
we are trying to cope with all social web site concepts that already exists<br />
without caring to much about the future. What I am thinking about right now is<br />
that we should try to make it as generic as possible to handle future concepts<br />
that don't even exists yet.</p>
<p>My question here is: is it valuable to know that an article have been posted on<br />
a Forum, a Blog, a Wiki, etc? Personally I don't think so because all these<br />
"concepts", or "technologies" are only ways to display and manage the<br />
information. However, the articles, the people leaving comments, etc, are<br />
always the same, always the medium change and not the content.</p>
<p>This said, I question myself about the utility, real value, of adding such type.</p>
<p>What do you think? I am not sure that my current thought is good, but I can't<br />
see the real added value.</p>
<p>Salutations,</p>
<p>Fred</p>

<p>At the moment, we can distinguish Posts / Comments using the has_reply<br />
/ reply_of property, eg in SPARQL:</p>
<p>PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#><br />
PREFIX sioc:   <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#><br />
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#></http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#></http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#></http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#></p>
<p>SELECT ?post ?title<br />
WHERE {<br />
  ?post sioc:title ?title .<br />
  OPTIONAL { ?_z sioc:has_reply ?post }<br />
  FILTER (!bound(?_z))<br />
}<br />
ORDER BY ?start</p>
<p>will return all nodes that are not reply_of other, i.e. will exclude comments.<br />
So I don't think ditinguish Post / Comments with different classes in<br />
the model is a real need.</p>
<p>Yet, with the current ontology, we can't distinguish Comments /<br />
Trackbacks, so I think that could be a more interesting update at the<br />
moment (using trackback_to/from properties, as discussed in a previous<br />
thread)</p>

<p>Re. trackback see posts 6-7 in this thread [1].</p>
<p>[GNU] is pointing to an existing property (from trackback "module")<br />
that we could use.<br />
Would be good to hear arguments pro-/contra- either of these options.</p>
<p>Initially I had a strong belief we need trackback properties, but now<br />
I am not so sure.</p>

<p>I agree too. Me and terraces leaved some thoughts on the #sioc channel about<br />
that question:</p>
<p>09:54	terraces	CaptSolo: Just got your mail re. proposals. How could we deal<br />
with tb wich are Posts and Comments, in a way ? BTW, I'm not sure comment is<br />
useful, as we calready now if a post is a replyy_of another or not. But maybe<br />
there are usecases where we should get a distinct property ?</p>
<p>09:56	fgiasson	I agree with terraces: a comment is a post. A post that links<br />
to another post, or a comment as we know it with blogs, are the same things</p>
<p>09:57	fgiasson	it is just a question of UI and physical data store, nothing<br />
relevant with the ontology</p>

<p>Any Post can be in has_reply relation to another post. This does not<br />
mean that the second post automatically becomes a comment.</p>
<p>What you and Alex are saying about reply_of and comments holds true<br />
for the current export practice (because we do not export inter-site<br />
relationships yet), but that might not be true for long.</p>
<p>Thinking in future we can extend has_reply further so that we can<br />
describe argumented discussion, say, that a reply agree or disagree<br />
with the original post.</p>
<p>We still need a way to say a comment is a Comment.</p>
<p>P.S. If you wanted to formalise that the object of has_reply is a<br />
Comment, then correct way would be to say it:<br />
[  sioc:Comment rdfs:subClassOf sioc:Post .<br />
   sioc:has_reply rdfs:range sioc:Comment . ]</p>

<p>Yes I understand your point, but my question is: what is the difference between<br />
a comment and a post?</p>
<p>For example, some people will reply to a blog post by another blog post. Each<br />
"article" are Post. However, some people will reply to a blog post by leaving<br />
comments on the original blog post.</p>
<p>The two practices are good, but one will be a comment, and another one will be<br />
a Post (but in the ontology, there should be a difference, but in reality there<br />
is none).</p>
<p>For me a sioc:Post is a thought, an idea, something new to a conversation,<br />
wrote by someone, nonobstand of how it is displayed (a post on a forum, a blog,<br />
a comment, a webpage, etc).</p>
<p>My point is that I think that we are trying to stick to current "concepts" such<br />
as blogs, wiki, webpages, comments, trackbacks (it's another story), etc, etc,<br />
etc. So I don't see, at least yet, the real utility of a class sioc:Comment.</p>
<p>Is it making sense?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Ehlo,<br />
  I tried to outline some similar thoughts earlier on the list... I<br />
dont think that there is a real need for SIOC to show relations like<br />
"is comment of", "posting is a comment"...</p>
<p>  Maybe we can reuse some other concepts and ontologies. What is the<br />
mission? SIOC is trying to model a community (of people) and their<br />
communication (by web addressable messages, like a weblog or a mp3<br />
file).</p>
<p>If we set up a basic set of SKOS concepts that describe the typical<br />
weblog structure with Posts/Articles/Entries/unameit and Comments/<br />
Sayings/... and Trackbacks/Pingbacks/...  We are able to say that a<br />
sioc:Post is a skos:Weblogentry and a sioc:isRelatedTo is a<br />
skos:Weblogcomment or a skos:Trackback. Maybe in 5 years weblogs are<br />
gone and we use something that is the same from a conceptual point of<br />
view: a thing that is published by someone and commented on by<br />
another-one. We only need to replace or migrate the SKOS concept used<br />
but dont need to change SIOC. Or what if a community moves from a<br />
google mailinglist to a webbased system?</p>
<p>And another one... what about tagging sioc:Post as tag:Comment or<br />
tag:Opinion or tag:ibisPro?</p>
<p> From my point of few SIOC should be use to describe communication:<br />
Users (organized in Usergroups) publish Posts which may be related to<br />
other Resources, that is a Community which is hosted on a Site. If<br />
weblog terminology is used a SKOS hierarchy for that is added, if we<br />
talk to the BBS world a other SKOS concept hierarchy is used.</p>

<p>I will answer to the seed email this weekend, but there are some of my thoughts<br />
about what John said:</p>

<p>Agree with you. Currently I was creating a Usergroup for each Forum. That way I<br />
has the possibility to say: this, this and this user belong to that Usergroup<br />
and then I know that if they belong to that group, then they are subscribed to<br />
the Forum.</p>
<p>In that case, is there a place for sioc:Usergroup?</p>
<p>> (7) Change has_sibling to sibling<br />

<p>Good idea too. The only reason of sibling_of was "The other sibling can be used<br />
as a source for any missing data.". We only have to list all sibling for each<br />
sioc:Post, it is not a big deal and make the ontology clearer.</p>
<p>Salutations,</p>

<p>Technically, nobody should be assuming that there is an inverse and<br />
what its name is just based on the fact that a property is called<br />
'has_...'.</p>
<p>It (the inverse) either is in the ontology or it isn't. Once "..._of"<br />
property is removed the "has_sibling" property can be defined to be a<br />
symetric property and used in both directions. Yet, if the consensus is<br />
to rename it to "sibling", so be it.</p>
<p>PS I am guilty of using undefined properties myself as it was the case<br />
with "has_group" in WordPress SIOC exporter. Sorry for that.</p>
<p>Best,<br />

      <p>I guess I should explain my ideas of the differences between Usergroups<br />
and Roles.  On a multi-user blogging system like Drupal or WPMU, a user<br />
can have a particular set of permissions towards a certain blog (e.g.<br />
owner, administrator, subscriber, editor, author, contributor, etc.)<br />
represented by the Role->Forum relationship but then they can also be a<br />
member of a usergroup (e.g. Bloggers) which has general permissions like<br />
being able to reply on anyone else's blog without logging in etc.</p>
<p>Same on bulletin boards, I can have a Role towards a particular forum<br />
(moderator access, can add/block users etc.) but still be part of an<br />
overall moderators Usergroup that has generic privileges like access to<br />
a private moderators area, ability to upload custom avatars etc.</p>
<p>I know the subscriber_of thing is a shortcut but I think it will be a<br />
useful one.</p>

      <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>Sorry, but I am really tired and my mind forgot some things about my last<br />
answer:</p>

<p>There I was talking about the SIOC integration into Talk Digger.</p>
<p>Check that diagram to see how Usergroup, Forum, and User are used into the<br />
system:</p>
