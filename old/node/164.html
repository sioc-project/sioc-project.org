      <p>Hi Uldis, all,</p>
<p>I tried to give it a go, being clear about that there are more experts<br />
in this list on the treated voacbularies and standards, I tried to<br />
outline relations to foaf, rss, dublin core, skos briefly.</p>
<p>http://esw.w3.org/topic/SIOC/RelatedOntologies</p>
<p>1) The main thing for this first attempt is that I found quite some<br />
issues which I think should be clarified before finalizing this<br />
document: I mentioned issues in bold text and in the last column of the<br />
the concluding table on the wiki page.</p>
<p>2) I think this document/section should evolve in parallel with</p>
<p>http://rdfs.org/sioc/mappings</p>
<p>On the wiki page I already sketched some mappings which IMO are missing<br />
and/or should be discussed.</p>
<p>opinions and corrections welcome,<br />
this definitly needs much refinement before it can go as part of the<br />
submission,</p>
<p>axel</p>
<p>p.s.: in the spec you also mention ontologies such as the KWeb portal<br />
ontology, the deri-swportal ontology, andreas' dblp ontology, etc.,etc.<br />
shall we treat these (IMO, only briefly, since these are all proprietary<br />
developments which were so far only used within a quite limited context.)</p>

> http://esw.w3.org/topic/SIOC/RelatedOntologies</p>
<p>Related ontologies document is now reformatted according to the format<br />
of W3C submission and available at:</p>
<p>http://sparql.captsolo.net/spec/related.html</p>
<p>You can continue to contribute changes to the wiki page - I will update<br />
the document accordingly.</p>
<p>About the issues mentioned in the document:</p>
<p>(1) Issue1: For instance sioc:avatar could have<br />
http://dublincore.org/2006/08/28/dctype.rdf#Image as a type.</p>
<p>We can do this (use it as a range of sioc:avatar). I have not seen it<br />
used much, but maybe I was looking in the wrong place.</p>
<p>There is also foaf:Image class that an avatar can be a type of.</p>
<p>(2) Issue2: This mapping does not yet appear in the mappings, but it<br />
should</p>
<p>What particular mapping do you mean by that?</p>
<p>(3) Issue3: The SIOC document mentions that sioc:first_name is<br />
deprecated and foaf:first_name property should be used instead. Note<br />
that this can only be done via the detour of either specifying the<br />
identifier of the foaf:person behind the user or using a blank node,<br />
since the domain of foaf:firstName (btw a typo in the ontology, it is<br />
firstName, not first_name in the foaf spec) is foaf:Person. This<br />
applies equally to the suggested deprecation of sioc:last_name.</p>
<p>There should not be a problem. A foaf:Person and its properties are<br />
used to describe the personal information of a user and, of course, it<br />
can have foaf:firstName property.</p>
<p>Thanks, a typo corrected.</p>
<p>We need to point to the related ontologies document from the<br />
specification and/or mention these first/last name properties in the<br />
"External classes and properties" section of the specification.</p>
<p>(4) Issue3: Besides, SIOC's email and email_sha1 properties seem to be<br />
redundant and equally expressible via blanks or a foaf:Person behind<br />
the account. Maybe not, if the user is a bot.</p>
<p>email and email_sha1 properties are not needed in many cases but they<br />
are there for a reason. it allows to keep the information that a user<br />
account (sioc:User) is associated with a particular email address. a<br />
person (foaf:Person) may have a number of different email addresses and<br />
by only using foaf:mbox you may use this link.</p>
<p>Suggestion: add a description to sioc:email and sioc:email_sha1<br />
properties telling when and why to use them.</p>
<p>(5) Issue4: Complementary/alternatively to Issue1, sioc:avatar could<br />
also reuse or at least foaf:depiction in order to link to user images.</p>
<p>Again, same as in (4) we should keep the link between a particular user<br />
account (sioc:User) and its avatar - that is why there's a sioc:avatar<br />
property.</p>
<p>We could subclass it from foaf:depiction, BUT i am not sure if the<br />
definition of foaf:depiction includes avatars who often would not<br />
contain a picture of a person (hence would not depict him/her), but<br />
would rather be a representation of this person or user account.</p>
<p>(6) Issue5: The subclassing of rss:item is not mentioned so far, but I<br />
thought it could be useful. To be discussed.</p>
<p>What would that give us?</p>
<p>There are properties that are common to sioc:Post and rss:item (Dublin<br />
Core properties), so it may make sense. At the same time a sioc:Post<br />
will not have all the properties of an rss:item, e.g. rss:title.</p>
<p>Another thing to do is create mappings and/or mapping services that<br />
convert information between SIOC and other popular formats. A sioc:Post<br />
will not contain all the fields that rss:item is required to have<br />
according to the specification, but it most certainly can be converted<br />
to RSS 1.0.</p>
<p>More issues were added by Alex recently:</p>
<p>(7) Issue: As someone mentionned on sioc-dev, we can't be sure to infer<br />
the good foaf:User if a sioc:User is share by more than one user. But<br />
in this case, maybe we must use a foaf:Group and add in the specs a<br />
owl:maxCardinality = 1 restriction to account_of (i.e. 1 account = 1<br />
Agent). BTW, we might think about some other cardinality restrictions,<br />
if needed.</p>
<p>Changed the range of account_of to foaf:Agent in the specification (as<br />
was decided earlier).</p>
<p>About the cardinality constraints let's keep the discussion in the<br />
existing thread "SIOC properties cardinality" that Alex started.</p>
<p>The question of a sioc:User being shared by more than one user is more<br />
of a theoretical case and also borders with how much information do we<br />
have about who is writing the content anyway.</p>
<p>That is all about the issues.</p>
<p>ToDo: add examples to the document.</p>

I've added one example for each related ontology + the complete sample<br />
sioc:Post at the end</captsolo@gmail.com></p>
<p>I've also added a section mentionning links from sioc to any ontology<br />
using sioc:topic. I'm not sure it's directly concerned with this<br />
document as it's not "related" ontologies, but can be useful to keep<br />
it in mind at least.</p>

<p>Me neither, it was just a suggestion...</p>
<p>> There is also foaf:Image class that an avatar can be a type of.</p>
<p>... maybe foaf:Image is better.</p>
<p>See also the table entry:<br />
sioc:avatar could subclass foaf:depiction (which has domain OWL:thing)<br />
which would restrict the range, or use dcmi:Image as range, Notably<br />
there is a difference with foaf:img which has a foaf:person as its range.</p>
<p>> (2) Issue2: This mapping does not yet appear in the mappings, but it<br />

 ><br />

<p>The original senctence here was:<br />
"Furthermore, foaf:name is subclassed by sioc:name to denote the name of<br />
a particular sioc:User or sioc:Usergroup."</p>
<p>must have been lost due to changes by Alexandre.<br />
I meant to say that this mapping doesn't appear in<br />
http://rdfs.org/sioc/mappings</p>

<p>My point is, HOW to use foaf:first_name. And the issue proposes 2 ways<br />
to do it, maybe better to add an example than an "issue", but wanted to<br />
clraify whether these two make sense. The point is that you cannot use<br />
foaf:first_name directly on sioc:User as the domain, but need a person<br />
in between.</p>
<p>> Thanks, a typo corrected.<br />

<p>something like that, yes.</p>

<p>We'd need to make<br />
foaf:Image a range of avatar (owuld be implicit by the subclassing)<br />
there is no restrictions on WHAT a foaf:Image depicts, so wouldn't be a<br />
problem. Question is whther changes in that are to be expected from foaf.</p>

<p>+1 for subclassing sioc:avatar from foaf:depiction, so we'll get<br />
foaf:image as a range, and the domain is OK + description "The<br />
foaf:depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an<br />
foaf:Image that depicts it"<br />
As Axel mentionned is in answer, the only problem if is foaf:depiction<br />
evolves, but we could change the mappings in this case.</p>

<p>Your sentence is still there but indeed, I added some text between it<br />
and the issue, sorry for that</p>

<p>I wrote a post + query about RSS 2 SIOC [1], and have planned to do<br />
queries for SIOC 2 RSS1.0 + Content module.<br />
I think we could have:<br />
- sioc:Forum => rss:channel<br />
- siocForum/dc:title => rss:channel/rss:title<br />
- sioc:Forum/dc:title => rss:channel/rss:title<br />
- sioc:Forum/rdf:about => rss:channel/rss:link<br />
- sioc:Forum/dc:description => rss:channel/rss:description<br />
- sioc:Forum/sioc:container_of => create rss:channel/rss:items list<br />
- sioc:Post => rss:item<br />
- sioc:Post/dc:title => rss:item/rss:title<br />
- sioc:Post/rdf:about => rss:item/rss:link<br />
- sioc:Post/sioc:content => rss:item/rss:description<br />
- sioc:Post/content:encoded => rss:item/content:encoded</p>
<p>I'm just wondering if a RSS feed could have more that one channel in<br />
it. (even if I didn't see any restriction in the specs), as it's<br />
needed for creating RSS feeds from SIOC data crawled from different<br />
sioc:forums.</p>
<p>If we all agree with the previous translation mappings, I'll wrote a<br />
translation query, then it could be nice to have a translation service<br />
(in both directions) on sioc-project.org.</p>
