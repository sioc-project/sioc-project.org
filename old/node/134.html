    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>The Captn has chased me around at #foaf for an extended period, and I<br />
know that you have a deadline for submission coming up RSN.</p>
<p>I'm the one who has done the semweb stuff at my.opera.com, and I'd like<br />
to express my support for what you're doing. Also, I think we will<br />
implement SIOC at my.opera.com as time allows, and I think we will<br />
support your W3C submission.</p>
<p>Now, I have to realize that I will not have the time to write the more<br />
elaborate discussion of the spec before your deadline, but I guess a<br />
not-very well thought out post is better than none, so here we go, and<br />
please bear over with me if I address issues that have allready been<br />
beaten to death earlier.</p>
<p>I can certainly see the value of the sioc:User/foaf:Person distinction<br />
in SIOC. It is the nature of community sites that we do not really know<br />
too much about the user who's publishing things, "on the Internet,<br />
nobody knows you're a dog" thus making foaf:Person alltogether rather<br />
inappropriate for community sites ;-) Also, it is difficult verify that<br />
a user isn't two or more persons or just a bot.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not arguing that we shouldn't use foaf:Person, quite the<br />
contrary. Using sioc:User as a wrapper around foaf:Person introduces<br />
some additional complexity, and I'm not sure it is worth it. Instead<br />
agents may just need to be a little more careful when making inferences<br />
based on data from a community site.</p>
<p>Also, I think it becomes quite difficult to know when to use the SIOC<br />
mbox and when to use the FOAF mbox, or both. Do I really need to use<br />
verify that the user is a person to use the FOAF properties, or?</p>
<p>So, that's my main concern, have you guys thought about it?</p>
<p>Now, I suppose that the specification is not set in stone with the<br />
submission to the W3C, so this is perhaps a discussion that could<br />
proceed after the submission?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Thank you for the support and feedback to this project. :)</p>
<p>Regarding having little time - we plan to extend the feedback period by<br />
approximately one week. This is in order to receive quality feedback<br />
from a number of new participants (like you) who just joined. Will<br />
announce this separately, but writing here so you know there is more<br />
time to explore and comment.</p>

<p>About verifying who is who - we shall leave that to the community sites<br />
who are SIOC data providers. If someone really wants he will find<br />
numerous reasons to doubt that something is a Person and will inflict<br />
unnecessary complexity. These sites usually do not have a way to<br />
distinguish if one is a real person or not (how do you know it's not<br />
just a very good bot?) so we work from assumption that posts are<br />
created by persons who have online accounts.</p>
<p>Note: a good thing is that sites themselves are interested to filter<br />
out spammers so they may take care to at least verify an email. As for<br />
sites that are spammers on purpose - you can't safeguard against that<br />
(w/o web of trust).</p>
<p>If you want to avoid defining creator of content a foaf:Person you<br />
might use a foaf:Agent instead, but there is little value in doing so.</p>
<p>> Now, I'm not arguing that we shouldn't use foaf:Person, quite the<br />

<p>sioc:User allows to express the fact that content is created by user<br />
accounts on a community site. there are properties that we may want to<br />
express about the online account in particular.</p>
<p>foaf:Person holds all properties that are not account specific.</p>
<p>There is value in having sioc:User information - some persons may have<br />
a number of accounts and there may be cases when you want to know what<br />
has been written by a particular account (though in majority of cases<br />
you might not care).</p>
<p>A solution we came up with recently is to assign a sioc:Post both<br />
sioc:creator_of and foaf:maker - this way sioc:User does not act as<br />
another layer "wrapping" foaf:Person and you can access FOAF data<br />
directly. An exaple of this can be see on WordPress SIOC export [1].</p>
<p>[1] http://test.rdfs.org/blog/index.php?sioc_type=post&amp;sioc_id=6</p>
<p>In cases when there is no user account (e.g., guest commenters on a<br />
blog) you would use only foaf:maker.</p>
<p>> Also, I think it becomes quite difficult to know when to use the SIOC<br />

<p>No. SIOC properties are not there because of concerns of one being a<br />
bot. It is rather a border case where we think a sioc:User may need it.<br />
Properties sioc:email and sioc:email_sha1 are meant to link a user<br />
account to a particular e-mail address it was registered with.</p>
<p>They are in the ontology to allow to retain this information for cases<br />
when this is important, but in many cases you will not need them. When<br />
in doubt always use foaf:Person and its mbox properties.</p>
<p>For this and other properties - maybe we need to improve their<br />
description in the specification. That should avoid the confusion.<br />
Please suggest any improvements that you see useful.</p>

<p>There is more time so we can discuss now. And after the submission is<br />
done of course. The submission to W3C is not set in stone and we will<br />
be making revisions to the specification as necessary, but it is harder<br />
to change once submitted (requires another submission). Let's make it<br />
good now, and improve later.</p>

<p>Yeah, we struggle rather hard with that problem. It isn't really that<br />
easy, as it boils down to a CAPTCHA, and most CAPTCHA things suck.</p>

<p>Right! Well, I do not doubt that there are valid use for sioc:User,<br />
however, consider a SPARQL query where you want some foaf property,<br />
you'd have to include a triple about the sioc:User to connect that to<br />
the foaf:Person before you can get the property you wanted. And that's<br />
why I ask if this complexity is warranted. </p>

<p>Indeed, using both foaf:Person and sioc:User for mentioning post<br />
creator (and only foaf:Person for answers from not registered users,<br />
i.e. blog comments) help to solve the problem you mention.<br />
SPARQL query at<br />
http://apassant.net/home/2006/06/sioc-browser/index.php/network uses<br />
only foaf:maker to get relationships between posts and users, avoiding<br />
the sioc:User / foaf:holdsAccount triples you mention.</p>
<p>I also think we should mention (in the specs ?) that exporting both<br />
type of relationships between post / user must be done by exporters,<br />
as it's done within WP exporter or in the API, so that we could unify<br />
SPARQL queries for a given set of users, registered or not (i.e.<br />
sioc:User or foaf:Person).</p>
