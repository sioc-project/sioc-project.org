  <dc:title>Negative experiences with Wordpress and Drupal plugins</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>I want to demonstrate the use of SIOC in Wordpress and/or Drupal for
biomedical research purposes, so I tried out the respective SIOC
plugins. My experience so far was quite negative -- both plugins did
not work for me.
I tried the newest Wordpress plugin with Wordpress 2.1, 2.0 and 1.6.
It was the same with each version: The plugin did not show up in the
plugin list of Wordpress. I had to add a header-section to the plugin
files so they would appear in the plugin list. However, after
activating the plugin, nothing changed. No additional SIOC statements;
Semantic radar did not indicate SIOC results.
I also tried the Drupal plugin with the newest version of Drupal
(4.9), but once again, the plugin was not even shown in the plugin
list, although I copied it into the correct directory.
