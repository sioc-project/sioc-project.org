  <dc:title>SIOC profile for 'sioc-project.org'</dc:title>
  <dc:description>A SIOC profile describes the structure and contents of a community site (e.g., weblog) in a machine processable form. For more information refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdfs.org/sioc&quot;&gt;SIOC project page&lt;/a&gt;</dc:description>

<sioc:Post rdf:about="http://sioc-project.org/node/105">
  <dc:title>About SIOC concepts / properties</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>To summarise about proposed ontology additions / changes:
= Decided:
1) Add sioc:Community
+ properties sioc:has_part and sioc:part_of pointing to and from it.
We are quite sure that a Community concept is needed.
There can still be some discussion about the property names and alternatives.
= Almost there:
2) sioc:Comment
Initially we thought &quot;let&#039;s make all posts generic - comments are same
as posts&quot;, but there&#039;s a need to distinguish between comments and
posts.
Proposal: create a [ sioc:Comment rdfs:subClassOf sioc:Post . ]
Comment is also a post, but a specific type of. That should solve the problem.
= Need your input:
3) Properties linking Site to Usergroup
We need a property to link sioc:Site to sioc:Usergroup (and inverse of it).
Proposals:
 - sioc:has_base / sioc:base_of
 - sioc:has_group / (name for inverse?)
Former proposed as a neutral name by John, later used in WordPress
exporter but undocumented in the ontology .
4) Property linking Site to Sub-Sites
sioc:Site may consist of a number of different subsites.
How do we express that?
Note: this is needed if a site consists of a number of heterogenous parts.
If a site consists of a number of forums (in a bulletin board) or
blogs (multi-user blog site), there already is a [ sioc:Site
sioc:host_of sioc:Forum . ] construct for that.
5) Subtypes of Forums ?
Same as for Posts/Comments we may want to express / search for a
specific type of [container of sioc:Posts].
Currently such a container is sioc:Forum, which is used to express all
types of community site &quot;containers&quot; - in practice most instance data
describe either blogs or boards/forums.
Proposal: subclasses of sioc:Forum:
 - Blog (Weblog?)
 - MailingList
 - NewsGroup
 - ... (Forum?! / Board / BulletinBoard)
Issue:
 - if we use sioc:Forum for generic container (would be consistent
with existing data), how do we name a particular subclass talking
about a board/forum ?
 - if we call it sioc:Forum (warning! redefining sioc:Forum now is
BAD), how do we can the generic container?
----
That&#039;s it. If there are more additions, will write about them in a
separate post. Things planned to write about: threads, roles
(moderator, admin), expressing that a user subscribes to a thread, ...
If there are no objections, I will add points (1) and (2) to the ontology.
For (3), (4) and (5) we need to decide.
They may be described in the issues list, but first I wrote them up
here in the email and let&#039;s see - some can be solved quickly and acted
upon, those that require more discussion will be added to IssuesList.
(If you want to add them to the IssuesList now, go ahead and do it!)
Best,
Uldis
