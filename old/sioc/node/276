  <dc:title>What about FOAF?</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi everybody,
At the moment SIOC is maturing very fast, which is good.
SIOC uses FOAF (friend of a friend) to describe persons on the
internet. Unfortunately the FOAF-specification seems to have been
stuck in version 0.1 http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ with many terms
categorized as &#039;unstable&#039;. The mailinglist has no activity, about a
month ago I sent some suggestions for FOAF, but received no reply.
At this moment I am unable to tell if there is anybody working on
FOAF, but looking at the state of the website http://www.foaf-project.org/
it seems that FOAF is dead.
With more and more implementations of SIOC currently being developed
many of them will also include an implementation of FOAF of which the
specification is far from finished and has quite a number of
problems.
I think it would be good if some people started working on a new
revision of the FOAF-specification. I would like to help with that,
but I don&#039;t really know where to start.
Kind regards,
John Hoogstrate
