  <dc:title>Property issues and suggestions</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi all -
I was awake at 3 AM a few days ago thinking of SIOC properties, and they
were keeping me awake so I had to come up with an acronym of ones to
remember (P-U-L-S) that I thought had some issues so that I could e-mail
you all for comments!
part_of
We disconnected this from Community so it could be used with Posts, but
I think having properties with neither domain or range may be a bit
weird.  If we come up with a replacement way of saying what containers
or user(groups) are in a community, I think this could be attached to post.
usergroup_of
At the moment, this points to a Site but I think should be changed to Space.
location_of or something like that
I was wondering if space_of could be replaced by something like
location_of, so that you could say for example that a Container is
located in a particular Space (or set of data spaces if so desired).
subset_of or something like that
It&#039;d be nice to be able to define subsets of Spaces and its subclasses
Site and Community.
Talk soon, good to hear your opinions,
John.
