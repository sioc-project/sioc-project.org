  <dc:title>sioc:User, foaf:Person or baetle:Person?</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Should baelte:reporter relate baetle:Issue(s) to foaf:Person or to
sioc:User ? It&#039;s not so obvious in some ways, since a sioc:User is a
subclass of a foaf:OnlineAccount, and it seems a bit weird to make an
online account responsible for fixing bugs.
This makes me wonder if perhaps the EvoOnt [1] way of doing things is
perhaps not in fact the right way of doing it. Create a baetle:Person
that is the range of relations such as baetle:creator,
baetle:reporter, etc... This removes the problems without closing
down options, so people can decide whether they then want to reporter
to be a foaf:Person or a sioc:Account

    baetle:reporter [ is ;
                      a foaf:Person, baetle:Person ];
    baetle:assigned_to [ a sioc:User, baetle:Person;
                         sioc:email  ] .
is this a cop out, or is this a good way to leave the decision to a
later time, and give people the freedom to extend the ontology as
they see fit?

PS. I am just working out how much I agree and disagree with EvoOnt
at the moment. If I completely agree, then there won&#039;t be much need
for baetle, except perhaps as an open forum to evolve EvoOnt, or as a
way to create software and todos  to help transform repositories to
this ontology.
PPS. sorry for the duplicate email. I sent this from the wrong
account intially
