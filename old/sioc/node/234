Journal of Web Semantics
SPECIAL ISSUE ON
WEB 2.0 AND THE SEMANTIC WEB
Submission Deadline: 1 June 2007

The cluster of technologies and design patterns known as Web 2.0 has now
emerged as the leading contender for the next evolution of the Web.
Researchers, developers, and venture capitalists are all flocking toward
the banner of Web 2.0, based on its promise of massively increased
sharing and participation among web users. At the same time, the
technologies of the Semantic Web have been quietly maturing and
spreading, and now provide a clear way to apply a basic level of formal
semantics to a web infrastructure. In their own way, both of these
technologies address the fundamental semantic concepts of shared meaning.
The Journal of Web Semantics solicits high quality papers on the impact
of the Web 2.0 revolution and the technology, deployment, and vision of
the Semantic Web. We are interested comparative papers that address both
directions of the impact:
1. Semantic Web technologies were initially designed before the rise of
the Web 2.0 methods for large-scale socially-contributed content. What
lessons should Semantic Web technologies draw from the popularity of tag
systems, social networks, mashups, and other Web 2.0 techniques? Does
the success of the social, user-oriented contribution models of Web 2.0
impact the way that Semantic Web data should be created, deployed,
exploited, managed, and shared? In short, should particular aspects of
the Semantic Web be reconsidered in the light of Web 2.0? For example:
 How can we exploit the wisdom of crowds to extend and maintain
ontologies and instance information? Could social software provide the
missing mechanisms for sharing ontologies and metadata? Are there
implications for existing family of web ontology languages?
 Is the existing work on Semantic Web Services adequate to support the
Web 2.0 world&#039;s practice of creating mashups?
 Are there particular extensions to the Semantic Web base architecture,
such as privacy, trust, and provenance, that could provide elegant and
economical solutions to Web 2.0 issues?
2. Web 2.0 applications always depend on some type of shared semantics
-- for example, between the software components of a mashup, or within
the user community that contributes to a particular tagging system. Can
the relative precision and rigor of Semantic Web representations and
inference add significant value to Web 2.0 applications?
 Are the various Semantic Web &quot;bridge&quot; technologies (like RDFa, GRDDL,
and SPARQL) adequate to the semantic demands of Web 2.0 applications?
 Can Semantic Web techniques be used to substantially enhance perceived
user value in Web 2.0 social networks, for example by linking across
communities?
 How could we leverage commercial Web 2.0 applications and design
patterns to increase the traction and uptake of the Semantic Web?
Topics of interest range from theoretical issues, methods, tools, system
descriptions and applications. We are also interested in high-quality,
carefully-argued discussion papers on the possibilities for convergence
between these two technologies.
Important Dates:
Deadline for submission: 1 June 2007
Notification of acceptance: 20 July 2007
Final Papers due: 10 August 2007
Special issue&#039;s publication: December 2007
Submissions:
We are interested in shorter (~10 pages), highly-targeted papers, which
may include concurrent publication (via the Journal of Web Semantics
Preprint Server) of companion ontologies, folksonomies, open-source
code, and the like. On-line paper submission is required, via Elseviers
Authors Portal for the Journal of Web Semantics. Elsevier has requested
that we remind authors to select Special Issue: Socio-Semantic Web
when they reach the Article Type step in the on-line submission process.
