  <dc:title>Fwd: SFI Funded PhD &amp;amp; MSc opportunity in UCD</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi All,
Information on 1 PhD &amp;amp; 1 MSc scholarship opportunity in UCD (Dublin,
Ireland) on OJAX++: A Next-Generation Collaborative Research Tool.
SIOC can play an important role in linking these different information
sources together. It is not directly mentioned in the document though
(unlike AJAX). It probably means we have to work more on promoting SIOC and
showing how to use it. :-)
Hope that someone in the SIOC community finds this information useful. And
maybe get to work on what you&#039;ve wanted to do for a long time. Please find
more information below and in the attached Word document. Feel free to
forward it to your friends and colleagues.

Hi Uldis,
   It was good to meet you at BarCamp. It was a shame you never made it to
the pub afterwards...
   Anyway, I said on the day I&#039;d send you the details of the PhD on offer in
UCD in case it would be of interest to anyone in the SIOC community.
   It is basically applying social web technology (which can of course
include semantic web technology), particularly linking different information
sources like institutional repositories, wikis, blogs etc.
together to create a collaborative research environment. It sounds like SIOC
could really help with that, in helping create a single repository with all
the metadata on who created what, when etc. Collaborative tagging,
recommender technology are also key elements.
   There is one PhD and one MSc.
   I&#039;ve attached the announcement.
       All the best,
          Padraig
