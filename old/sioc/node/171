  <dc:title>Making Content into Literals in AtomOWL</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>I am sending this to sioc-dev too, as sioc was thinking of using
the :Content element from atom-owl.
As I am thinking of changing this, I thought you should know.
-------
Hi, my previous post was a little long, which may not have made it
clear that I am thinking of changing the ontology.
The idea is to use literals wherever they seem obviously suited. This
requires us to use create the following new literal types:
    - :xhtml
    - :html
    - :xml
I had thought of doing this before but was help up by two things
(that I can remember)
    1. I had not seen literals used widely with special types
    2. This would then mean that the :content relation would point
sometimes to a literal, sometimes to a object, which would not be OWL-DL
    3. It seemed more flexible to not use literals
To take these points one by one:
1. Special Literals
-------------------
I have just discovered that Fresnel uses its own Literal types such
as fresnel:styleClass.
So for example in http://simile.mit.edu/repository/longwell-demos/
atom/fresnel.n3 one can find
:generatorFormat rdf:type fresnel:Format ;
          fresnel:propertyFormatDomain atom:generator ;
          fresnel:propertyStyle &quot;atom-generator&quot;^^fresnel:styleClass ;
          fresnel:valueStyle &quot;atom-generator-
value&quot;^^fresnel:styleClass ;
          fresnel:group :atomgr .
2. The :content relation
------------------------
If we think of a  element with a source as below

          Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok

          urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a
          2003-12-13T18:30:02Z
          

as being equivalent to a
 as below

          Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok

          urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a
          2003-12-13T18:30:02Z


Then we can convert the above rdf to the following N3
[] a :Entry;
     :title &quot;Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok&quot;^^:text
     :link [ :href 
             :rel iana:alternate ];
     :id &quot;urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a&quot;^^xsd:anyURI;
     :updated &quot;2003-12-13T18:30:02Z&quot;^^xsd:dateTime;
     :link [ :href 
             :rel :content;
           ] .
In accord with the following UML diagram.
