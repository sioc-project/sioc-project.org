  <sioc:content>Call for Papers
2nd International ExpertFinder Workshop:
FEWS2007 (Finding Experts on the Web with Semantics)
http://fews.semanticweb.org/
Busan, Korea, 12th November 2007
co-located with the 6th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC
2007) and 2nd Asian Semantic Web Conference (ASWC 2007)
=============================================
ExpertFinder (http://rdfweb.org/topic/ExpertFinder) is an emerging
collaborative initiative with the aim of devising vocabulary, rule
extensions (for e.g. FOAF and SIOC) and best practices to annotate
personal home pages, as well as web pages of institutions, conferences,
publication indexes, etc. with adequate metadata to enable computer
agents to find experts on particular topics.
Following the 1st ExpertFinder workshop
(http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/~aleman/efw2007) during the Knowledge Web NoE
general assembly in January 2007, the ExpertFinder initiative would like
to solicit research contributions from the wider Semantic Web expert
community.
ExpertFinder&#039;s goal is to enable a Web-scale infrastructure for the
creation, publication and use of experts&#039; semantic descriptions to
support expert finding scenarios such as group management, disaster
response, recruitment, team building, problem solving and on-the-fly
consultation. Descriptions of such scenarios can be found at
http://rdfweb.org/topic/ExpertFinderUseCases. We welcome all submissions
which describe original research contributing to this goal.
Topics of Interest
==================
We welcome all research contributions that address one or more of the
following topics:
* Specification of vocabularies to describe experts
* Reuse of existing standards and taxonomies to describe experts
* Extraction of expert descriptions from legacy (meta)data
* Use of microformat data to locate experts
* International and cross-organisational heterogeneity issues in the
expert descriptions
* Algorithms for expert finding and recommendation (e.g., mining of
social networks)
* Expressivity extensions (in logics, rules) to support expert finding
processes
* Tools for the intuitive creation and maintenance of expert
descriptions and associated rules
* Web infrastructures for the publication and sharing of expert
descriptions (storage, access, querying, rule execution, coordination,
communication)
* Security, trust and privacy aspects of expert finding
* Scalability to the Web level
* Integrating expert finding research into legacy systems to support
industrial uptake
Event Information
=================
The workshop will take place during the 6th International Semantic Web
Conference (ISWC2007) and 2nd Asian Semantic Web Conference (ASWC2007)
For every accepted paper at least one of the authors must attend the
workshop and must register for the workshop and the main conference.
Submission Information
