  <dc:title>sioc:reply_of in flat threads</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi!
I&#039;m currently working on a SIOC exporter for vBulletin using Alex&#039;s
SIOC PHP API.
As vBulletin uses flat threads, I was thinking about the correct way
to use the sioc:has_reply and sioc:reply_of properties for posts.
The problem here is that we can&#039;t know for sure which post the author
of a follow-up post is replying to:
It could be a reply to the previous post in the thread, to the thread
starting post or even to multiple posts in the thread.
So how can we use the sioc:reply_of property for a post in a flat
thread - should it point to the immediately previous or the thread
starting post - or even all or none of previous posts? [1]
In a discussion [2] on #sioc irc channel it was proposed to use
sioc:Thread [3] to indicate that sioc:Posts are part of a discussion.
It was then suggested to either have
* each post marked as a reply to the first post or
* something like a linked list of posts using sioc:next_by_date and/or
sioc:previous_by_date
and maybe add a property like sioc:first_post to sioc:Thread so that a
query is able to find the first post of a thread (sioc:first_post
being a subproperty of sioc:container_of)
Then rules could be used to deduce more knowledge about the thread and
its reply structure later.
Any comments and suggestions are very welcomed.
Regards,
Thomas
[1] Ideally a web forum application would store the IDs of posts that
are quoted in a reply, but vBulletin doesn&#039;t do that in a useful way.
