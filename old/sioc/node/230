  <dc:title>SIOC ontology revisions</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi All,
&gt; The list of SIOC types at [1] looks good. There may be some
&gt; fine-tuning of SIOC types as we implement them, some properties may be
&gt; moved up from Post to Item, but all in all it is a good start and lets
&gt; us move forward.
In order to finish SIOC ontology revisions that John posted about
recently, please have a look at the changes in the SIOC ontology [1]
and SIOC types module [2] in SVN. This is the first part of revision,
with the second part being new properties still in discussion on a
separate thread [3].
[1] http://sw.deri.org/svn/sw/2005/08/sioc/ontology/ns.rdf
[2] http://sw.deri.org/svn/sw/2005/08/sioc/ontology/types.rdf
[3] http://groups.google.com/group/sioc-dev/browse_thread/thread/a443ae44fc9b0441
Changes include new classes (but not properties) in the SIOC ontology
and many new subtypes in SIOC types module. If you are OK with these
changes, we can publish them tomorrow.
One question which I have is how do you correctly &quot;import&quot; external
classes into the ontology and say that, e.g., doap:Project is a
sioc:Item? The solution currently implemented in types.rdf is [
doap:Project rdfs:subClassOf sioc:Item ]. It avoids duplicating a
doap:Project class within SIOC (a good thing), but might also be
called an intrusion in the structure of another ontology. That&#039;s why I
am asking about it.
While writing this here are some more improvements we may do:
 - subclass sioc:topic from a dc:subject;
 - create sioct:InstantMessage as a subtype of sioc:Post - prompted by
a question by Jaroslaw on how to model instant messages in SIOC.
That&#039;s it for the types module and please write your thoughts about
the new properties discussed in [3].
Best regards,
Uldis Bojars
