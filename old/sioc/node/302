  <dc:title>Multi-linguality in SIOC</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi All,
Multi-linguality in SIOC is something we need to think about. Summer
is a bit quieter season than usual on SIOC-Dev, but there&#039;s a lot to
do and I hope this message will raise us all to some constructive
discussion.
Immediate reasons that made me write this post:
 - SSSW 2007 summer school, which I am at now. It brings together an
interesting and very multi-cultural groups of students, tutors and
organisers (and you realise English is not the only language in the
world);
 - Stehanie Booth giving a talk today at Google about languages on the
Internet [1].
There are 2 main directions for multi-language support in SIOC:
1) Ontology
We can translate the ontology (labels and comments for all classes and
properties) into other languages, similarly as it&#039;s done with DOAP.
End-users could benefit from this, but mainly if they use generic RDF
browsers which make use of these labels and comments.
All the term comments and labels have xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; (thanks for the
suggestion to add it!) and hence translations in other languages can
be simply added. All we need is those translations. :)
2) Data
Establish how to express multi-language content in SIOC RDF. This
should be entirely possible with the existing SIOC ontology, just need
to add a property (dc:lang) to specify what language a post/item is
in. This possibly has a larger impact than 1) but a question is how to
get those data? Do blog engines (say, WordPress or MovableType) always
know what language a post is in?
Of course, it depends on our requirements. If we find out that a
post/content can have multi-language content inside it (= there is &gt;1
language per post) and we want to model these fragments, that may
require a somewhat more complex solution.
What do you think about it? What are the best approaches to solve
this, what are the challenges?
