  <dc:title>Fwd: [Activerdf] RDFa On Rails</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>FYI. This will be of interest for anyone working with SIOC and RoR.
Thanks, Cédric! :)
One more thing which would be good to have if you produce embedded
SIOC RDF (in RDFa or eRDF) is to add RDF autodiscovery links (e.g.,
pointing to RDF extracted by a service like triplr) in pages created.
That would aid the users of Semantic Radar and increate the number of
people who see this information.
P.S. Is there something similar to RDFa on Rails in PHP?

Subject: [Activerdf] RDFa On Rails
To: ActiveRDF users 
Hi all,
I just released the early version of RDFa on Rails, a library of
helper methods to help rails developers producing RDFa data. The focus
is on building an API with common stuff such as resources, label,
title, creator, person, tags and blog posts etc. and let the
possibility to extend easily the API. Making it a central point for
developers to find the classes or predicates they need...
The gem package also includes a typo rdfa theme which produces rdfa data.
Here are a few resources:
 * a blog post ,
http://myunderstanding.wordpress.com/2007/05/29/rdfa-on-rails-the-semantic-web-made-simple/
 * the project website, http://rdfa.rubyforge.org/
Help and comment is welcome, especially from you guys working with
ruby and rdf for a long time :-) I am quite sure we can find
interactions between ActiveRDF, SWAF in general and RDFa on Rails.
Let the show begin!
