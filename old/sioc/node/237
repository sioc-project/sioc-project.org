  <dc:title>online SIOC explorer</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi all,
As John Breslin just described [1] on his blog, we have developed a simple
online SIOC explorer, allowing you to read SIOC content like in a blog
aggregator.
The UI is still quite unfinished and importing new blogs/forums is a bit
broken right now, but I announce it anyway in the spirit of &quot;release early
and often&quot;, these small glitches will be fixed in the next days.  Reading
and browsing current content works fine already and all the code is
off-course open-source [3].  If you have any feedback (including: dude,
this and this doesn&#039;t work) please reply or file a bug [4].
Developing this application lead to several SIOC-related questions and
ideas on our side, I&#039;ll elaborate on that in another email tomorrow.
(I&#039;m by the way a PhD researcher in DERI. I have also developed ActiveRDF
[2] which connects RDF data to Ruby-on-Rails.  The SIOC explorer is a
showcase of data integration and semantic web application development using
RDF, ActiveRDF, and Rails. And hopefully it will help in making SIOC data
visible and usable to end-users.)
