  <dc:title>Semano - Survey on my final year project.</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hello,
Semano, the Semantic Web Annotater, was my final year project this
year in Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.
I have made a website for it at the following link:
http://www.minds.may.ie/~provost/semano/
What it does is it tries to relate XML files to OWL Ontologies (files
made to allow computer applications process information easier).
If anyone would like to help me out with the project, you can easily
test it by using the Quickstart guide to Semano at the following link:
http://www.minds.may.ie/~provost/semano/quickstart.html
You could then give some feedback on what you think of it using the
survey at the following link:
http://www.minds.may.ie/~provost/semano/survey.html
I&#039;d appreciate it if as many of you as possible would give it a shot.
The more feedback, the better!
If you could get the feedback in before the end of the week, or as
soon as possible, that would be great.
Thanks
Paul Mara
