  <dc:title>SIOC profile for 'sioc-project.org'</dc:title>
  <dc:description>A SIOC profile describes the structure and contents of a community site (e.g., weblog) in a machine processable form. For more information refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdfs.org/sioc&quot;&gt;SIOC project page&lt;/a&gt;</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Twitter - more info in RDF</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>See more ideas about Twitter in RDF below:
&gt; 4) Replies
&gt; If a post (A) has &quot;@reply&quot; to another user/post (B) (twitter homepage
&gt; already includes a hyperlink to a post it thinks this is in reply to)
&gt; that can be described as:
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; 
Keith has a point (re. IRC discussion) that the meaning of &quot;@nick&quot; on
twitter may not necessarily mean that one message is in response to
another.
That is how twitter home page interprets it when saying &quot;in response
to &quot; and linking to the last message written by that person. But
it is not necessarily what that person mean (determining what someone
was thinking about may be a difficult task anyway :).
There are different options depending on how much we can derive from a
twitter message and how deep into detail we want to do. You could:
a) just say &quot;person X mentioned person Y in his message (A)&quot; - but
would probably need a new (quite specific?) property for that.
b) say that &quot;person X replied to person Y in his message (A)&quot; without
specifying a particular message by Y that a reply is to. you could
model this case similar are you would model Usenet or email messages -
by Y being a recipient of a message.
c) say that &quot;person X in his message (A) replied to person&#039;s Y last
message (B)&quot; - in this case you can use sioc:has_reply.
... there can be more ways to look at it ...
Depends on what you want to use this information for.
&gt; 5) More possibilities ...
&gt; have any cool ideas. E.g., you could go to person&#039;s homepage, extract
&gt; RDF (e.g., FOAF, SIOC) autodiscovery links from it and add it to the
&gt; exporter RDF.
same with RDF embedded in person&#039;s homepage, of course.
Another idea:
Extract hyperlinks from tweet text and express them as sioc:links_to:
