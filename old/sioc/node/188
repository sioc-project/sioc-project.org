  <dc:title>Semantic Radar for Opera &amp;amp; Internet Explorer users !!!</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Semantic Radar [1] has been available as a Firefox browser extension
for sime time now.
[1] http://sioc-project.org/firefox/
That brings questions from users of other browsers (Opera, IE, Safari,
...) - can we get it for our browser. Until now the answers was no.
Plus I decided against writing a BHO specifically for IE - that would
not be a rational use of resources.
Semantic Radar / JS [2] is an answer to the question. It&#039;s a JavaScipt
user script that shall work with Opera and GreaseMonkey in Firefox.

I will appreciate if someone could suggest how to adapt it with
Internet Explorer. Checked it now with Trixie and Turnabout for IE,
but it did not work &quot;out of the box&quot;. This means some work and
collaborative effort is necessary to get this thing really running.
There are 3 applications (AFAIK) that can run user javascript on IE:
GreaseMonkeyIE, Trixie and Turnabout.
This is (one of many places in SIOC Project) where you can get
involved. Please test how SemRadar/JS works for you and send your
bugreports and fixes. Testing this with many different combinations of
browsers and web pages can be a laborous task and unfortunately there
is only so much I can do w/o help. :)
P.S. Ideally it would be good if someone would sign up as a &quot;module
owner&quot; for SemRadar/JS at least for getting and keeping it working
with Internet Explorer, Opera and other browsers (I mainly use Firefox
and its SemRadar extension).
P.P.S. There are other places where help is needed. Especially in
testing how our tools work in different conditions (for different
webpages, different versions of blog engines, browsers, ...),
reporting back if there are problems and suggesting how to fix them.
All such feedback can be sent to this list.
I&#039;ve created a new wiki page HowToParticipate [3] for information like
this. If you have any SIOC Project (or SemWeb in general) tasks that
need help please describe them on the page. That includes new ideas
(maybe another page is needed for that) which you think are cool but
are not able to implement right now. Maybe there&#039;s someone out there
looking for a cool idea to do. :)
