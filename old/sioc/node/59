  <dc:title>SIOC profile for 'sioc-project.org'</dc:title>
  <dc:description>A SIOC profile describes the structure and contents of a community site (e.g., weblog) in a machine processable form. For more information refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdfs.org/sioc&quot;&gt;SIOC project page&lt;/a&gt;</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Revisions to the SIOC Ontology</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi, All !
Below is information about proposed changes to the SIOC ontology. John
Breslin and me have made a summary of them which I am posting here to
collect your feedback.
General info about SIOC: http://rdfs.org/sioc/
The actual changes to RDFS/OWL &quot;code&quot; can be seen as the difference
between current ontology [1] and the version with proposed changes
implemented [2]. A part of these changes have been discussed on
SIOC-Dev and RDF-Web mailing lists before.
In particular we will be grateful if those of you who have experience
in designing and improving the FOAF ontology would help improve SIOC.

[2] http://sw.deri.org/svn/sw/2005/08/sioc/ns/sioc
A detailed list of changes:
http://sw.deri.org/svn/sw/2005/08/sioc/ns/CHANGES
=1= Use foaf:Person instead of sioc:User for person&#039;s data
Name, surname and other personal data will be described via a
foaf:Person, which will point to the sioc:User (person&#039;s account on the
community site) using foaf:holdsAccount property.
Actions:
 - deprecate sioc:first_name and sioc:last_name
Open questions:
 - how to keep the information that this _particular_ account is
associated with a given e-mail address (or hash of it)? we might also
deprecate foaf:email and foaf:email_sha1 and use FOAF properties, but
shall we not worry that when person&#039;s data are smushed together we
loose a link between OnlineAccount and an e-mail address?
 - same can be true of name (e.g., if the person has a different name
specified for each site)
=2= Changes to properties representing plain/rich content
sioc:content is redundant - SIOC has sioc:description (subclass of
dc:description) using which is more consistent.
sioc:content_encoded - there is already content:encoded module for RSS
1.0 that can be used to describe encoded content (e.g., HTML). let&#039;s
leave it out of SIOC ontology for now as encoding and describing rich
content can be a complex task.
Actions:
 - deprecate sioc:content (use sioc:description instead) and
sioc:content_encoded (use content:encoded instead)
 - change rdfs:comment for sioc:description accordingly (TODO)
=3= Cleanup
Remove:
- commented out events related properties (starts_at, finished_at,
event) - events are outside scope
- sioc:is_category and sioc:is_closed
- sioc:location
Change property name / fix description:
 - sioc:has_revisor to :has_modifier (modification better describes
changing the Post)
 - sioc:reference to :links_to (reference has vague meaning, also does
not fit out naming convention)
 - sioc:revisor_of to :modifier_of
Change range:
 - sioc:type - range to rdfs:Resource
=4= Change roles / permissions properties
Change description and domain/range:
 - sioc:function_of - range to sioc:user (removes Usergroup from its
range)
 - sioc:has_scope - range to sioc:Forum
 - sioc:scope_of - range to Resource
=5= Changes to subject, topic, title
Separate subject information into:
 - text (e.g., keywords) described by sioc:subject
 - resources (e.g., SKOS concepts) described by sioc:topic
Actions:
 - change description of sioc:subject + remove domain of sioc:Post +
subclass from dc:subject
 - change description of sioc:topic + change range to rdfs:Resource
 - add sioc:title property (take former description of sioc:subject) +
subclass from dc:title
=6= Names, IDs
add sioc:id - a new property to represent the ID of the SIOC object
(e.g., user ID, post ID, ...)
change description of sioc:name to use it to represent user / account
names for sioc:User(s) and sioc:Usergroup(s)
=Open Questions=
-?- Shall we subclass sioc:created_at and sioc:modified_at from dc:date
or dc_terms:issued and dc_terms:modified ?
-?- Shall we subclass sioc:link (used to describe link to a web page
about the SIOC object - Post, User, ...) from dc:identifier ?
-?- Shall we change the way we represent modifications / different
versions of the data? Currently we have rather simple next_version,
previous_version and has_modifier, modifier_of. Another option is to
introduce &quot;modification events&quot; that we can add more information to [at
a cost of the complexity of data/ontology]
CHANGES file has slightly more details, though I&#039;ve covered 95% of them
in this post.
Note to developers: some of the proposed changes will have impact on
the SIOC export tools. Please come to the SIOC-Dev mailing list,
discuss and ask for more information if needed.
Best regards,
Uldis
