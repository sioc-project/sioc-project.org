                   2nd Workshop on Social Aspects of the Web

    11th International Conference on Business Information Systems (BIS 2008)
                               Innsbruck, Austria

================================================================================
In recent years, the Web has moved from a simple one-way communication channel
extending traditional media, to a complex &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; communication space
with a blurred author/audience distinction and new ways to create, share and
use knowledge in a social way.
This change of paradigm is currently profoundly transforming most areas of our
life: our interactions with other people, our relationships, ways of gathering
informations, ways of developing social norms, opinions, attitudes and even
legal aspects as well as ways of working and doing business.
That change also raises a strong need for theoretical, empirical and applied
studies related to how people may interact on the Web, how they actually do so
and what new possibilities and challenges are emerging in the social, business
and technology dimensions. 
The goal of this workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners together to
explore the issues and challenges related to social aspects of the Web. We want
to facilitate discussion on topics including theoretical, empirical and applied
studies related to:
