  <dc:title>SIOC profile for 'sioc-project.org'</dc:title>
  <dc:description>A SIOC profile describes the structure and contents of a community site (e.g., weblog) in a machine processable form. For more information refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdfs.org/sioc&quot;&gt;SIOC project page&lt;/a&gt;</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Contribution from UMU to SIOC Ontology</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>These are the comments, questions and suggestions that have come up as
a result of our analysis of the SIOC ontology. We have generated
comments for a number of main concepts in the ontology. The following
is a list of the concepts which received some comments from our side:
·Forum
      -    It is declared that a forum will have a moderator or
administrator, but how is this relation represented in the model? Does
it come implicitly by a concrete role played by a subscriber of the
forum?
      -    The meaning of  &quot;scope_of&quot;  property is not quite clear.
Does it mean that a forum is only visible to a fixed type of role? Or
is it interesting to a specific type of role?
Another possibility that we have thought of is that this property tries
to represent the administration relation that we have mentioned in the
previous point, but it seems a bit weird, because is a user who
moderates a Forum, not a role.
      -    A forum could be devoted to a certain group of users, but
how is represented the relation among forums and groups of users, that
is to say, how do you associate a group of user with a forum? It seems
that neither a direct relation nor an indirect one model this fact.
·Post
      -    &quot;Content&quot; and &quot;description&quot; properties have got the same
semantic meaning; it seems that there is no difference between them. We
have read in [1] that currently it is being considered the idea of
inserting AtomOWL to represent the content of a post, which sounds to
be a good choice. So we suppose that these two properties will be
reduced to one of this AtomOWL type.
·User
      -    As in Forum class, we can&#039;t see a relation that allows
representing that a user is moderator of a forum or site, as is stated
in the specification. That is to say, we miss a property that relates a
user with the administrator role with a forum, and its inverse (a forum
that is administrated by a user), like &quot;subscriber_of&quot;  property does.
·Usergroup
      -    Should &quot;usergroups&quot; have a role? It is not explicitly
mentioned in the specifications, and there isn&#039;t any relation between
this class and the &quot;Role&quot; class that could state this situation. For
example, a group of users could be defined as banned users or as
administrator of a site. Then, users could be added to these groups
without the necessity of specifying their roles, as they could be
inferred from the group where they belong to.
·About  &quot;topic&quot; property
        We think that &quot;topic&quot; property should be modelled as a class
and not as a property, since topic is a sufficiently important entity
to having its own properties: category, description, keywords, impact
factor, etc.
