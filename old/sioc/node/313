  <dc:title>URIs in SIOC</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi,
first I have to apologize if this posting floods your inbox; there
seem to be problems with google groups and I keep getting error
messages about not being allowed to post here... Seems I lost control of
what gets posted and how often.
My question is about the use of URIs in SIOC:
In the few examples on your project homepage and in the sioc-files
floating around in the wild it seems that there is a common (and, as
far as this mailing list goes, undisputed) practice of using document-
URIs for non-document resources. sioc:user, for example, is almost
always identified as some HTML-document, same for sioc:site and,
sometimes, sioc:container/sioc:forum.
Is this by design? Is sioc:user something like a hidden
sioc:userHomepage, the way FOAF uses a workplaceHomepage rather than a
URI for the company I work at? If so, wouldn&#039;t this break the concept
of sioc:user being a sub-property of foaf:Account?
In other words: If I use a non-document URI for a sioc:user or a
sioc:forum (which a thought would be more elegant), do I break things
or is it just a matter of preference?
Thank you for your support,
Oskar
