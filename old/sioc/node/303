  <dc:title>ANN:  UMBEL Subject Reference Project</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi All,
You are cordially invited to comment or participate in the UMBEL
(Upper Mapping and Binding Exchange Layer) project.  I think it will
be a very nice complement to SIOC.
UMBEL is a lightweight way to describe the subject(s) of Web content,
akin to the relationship &quot;isAbout&quot;. It is meant to work universally
with HTML, tagging, microformats or other standard practices,
including various RDF schemas and more formal ontologies.  Its
reference subject &#039;backbone&#039; is derived from the intersection of
common subjects found on popularly used Web sites and other accepted
subject references.
UMBEL is very simple with few ambitions.  It is merely a reference
&#039;bag of subjects&#039; to help relate Web data sets to one another.
UMBEL makes no presumptions to replace formal domain or upper
ontologies, has little or no inferential power, and makes no
assumptions about the means to describe or serialize the underlying
data.  UMBEL is meant to work with data sets ranging from RSS and Atom
feeds to tagging, microformats, RDF, existing schema and other data
and metadata models.  UMBEL&#039;s development is being backed by a number
of leading open data efforts and entities.
In addition to its core reference subjects, the UMBEL project will be
providing look up, query, registration, pinging, and related services.
The project is completely open under a community process with all
products available via Creative Commons licenses.
The initial project site is at http://www.umbel.org, including an
introduction (http://www.umbel.org/intro.xhtml) (the best place to
start!) and the draft project specification (http://www.umbel.org/
proposal.xhtml).
A mailing list you can monitor or join is at http://groups.google.com/group/umbel-ontology.
We welcome and invite your participation!
Best regards,
Mike Bergman
