  <dc:title>SIOC extensions proposal</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi All,
The following are some ideas we want to propose for extensions to SIOC
ontology.
Best Regards,

SIOC extensions
Class sioc:Forum
Suggested additions:
In domain of
sioc:topic  - The topic tags can be inferred from the content.
sioc:feed range uri.  This occurs once per each type of aggregation
resource containing data from the forum.  Examples are RSS feeds, ATOM,
OPML etc.  The URI can be used for differentiating the format and
reading the feed itself provides final certainty.  We do not create a
separate node for all this information here.
sioc:related_feed  range uri / This represents links to related feed
files which do not themselves contain data from the forum.  Links in a
blog roll are examples.
sioc:membership_model one of sioc:private, sioc:public, sioc:moderated.
 Many social applications such as Yahoo groups have policies for
accepting new members/subscribers.  This can represent the model
applicable there.
Subclasses of sioc:Forum
Class sioc:Weblog
In domain of:
Class sioc:Wiki
In domain of:
sioc:markup range string  - Name of the markup used, e.g. twiki.
Class sioc:Bookmarks
Class sioc:News_reader
This is intended for an RSS/ATOM aggregator.
In domain of
sioc:links_to range uri
This references the feed URI&#039;s which are being aggregated  by this
reader.
Class sioc:Newsgroup
This is intended for a NNTP newsgroup, a Yahoo groups type forum etc.
In domain of
sioc:posting one of sioc:public, sioc:moderated, sioc:read_only.
Class sioc:Photo_album
This is intended for both a photo archive site and an individual album,
where album is analogous with a file system directory.
Subcllasses of sioc:Post
Class sioc:Photo
In domain of:
Any attributes from  EXIF in the namespace
http://www.w3.org/2003/12/exif/ns  .
Further Possibilities
The items discussed so far are typically public.  If we extend  the
ontology to managing a desktop or user workspace, we can also model
email and file system content.   This would be a RDF version of Apple&#039;s
Spotlight, so to speak.  Acdcess privileges and full text search will
be significant there, ODS will experiment with these things.
