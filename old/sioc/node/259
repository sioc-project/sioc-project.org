  <dc:title>Danny&amp;#039;s post: &amp;quot; General rambling, plus a challenge&amp;quot;</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Bumping up a post Danny wrote, with a challenge - to make Lazyweb
ecosystem that works. &quot;SIOC can capture all the relevant bits of
information - the challenge is to deploy it in way that&#039;s
maintainable.&quot; - Anyone up for the task?

&gt; Challenge first:
&gt;
&gt; Ben Hammersley had a lovely setup with Lazyweb.org. You write some
&gt; idea on your own blog, do a trackback ping to a particular URI, your
&gt; idea is collected and republished there. Over here you felt like you
&gt; might reach someone that might make your idea a reality, over there
&gt; you saw a stream of bright ideas (and a fair number of answers).
&gt;
&gt; It died because of the maintenance problem of trackback spam.
&gt;
&gt; The single point of failure was the URI which got pinged. Get rid of
&gt; that, maybe it might work again. SIOC can capture all the relevant
&gt; bits of information - the challenge is to deploy it in way that&#039;s
&gt; maintainable.
&gt;
&gt; The ramble I had planned starts like this:
&gt;
&gt; * Mailing lists suck.
&gt; * Forums suck.
&gt; * IM/IRC channels suck.
&gt; * Blogs suck.
&gt; * Wikis suck.
&gt;
&gt; - but I&#039;ve run out of steam.
&gt;
&gt; I can tell you what provoked the intended ramble: my annoyance with
&gt; the tech we&#039;re looking at - simply trying to find good information
&gt; about electric guitar bodies. An arbitrary end-user application of the
&gt; Web. The information and the people you need to talk to are there and
&gt; willing, but you spend more time...oh, you know what I mean. I think
&gt; SIOC has a lot of what is needed. Now fix it, will you..?
&gt;
&gt; (One domain-specifc site could lead the way. Not that I&#039;m hinting.)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Danny.
