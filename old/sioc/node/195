  <dc:title>General rambling, plus a challenge</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Challenge first:
Ben Hammersley had a lovely setup with Lazyweb.org. You write some
idea on your own blog, do a trackback ping to a particular URI, your
idea is collected and republished there. Over here you felt like you
might reach someone that might make your idea a reality, over there
you saw a stream of bright ideas (and a fair number of answers).
It died because of the maintenance problem of trackback spam.
The single point of failure was the URI which got pinged. Get rid of
that, maybe it might work again. SIOC can capture all the relevant
bits of information - the challenge is to deploy it in way that&#039;s
maintainable.
The ramble I had planned starts like this:
* Mailing lists suck.
* Forums suck.
* IM/IRC channels suck.
* Blogs suck.
* Wikis suck.
- but I&#039;ve run out of steam.
I can tell you what provoked the intended ramble: my annoyance with
the tech we&#039;re looking at - simply trying to find good information
about electric guitar bodies. An arbitrary end-user application of the
Web. The information and the people you need to talk to are there and
willing, but you spend more time...oh, you know what I mean. I think
SIOC has a lot of what is needed. Now fix it, will you..?
(One domain-specifc site could lead the way. Not that I&#039;m hinting.)
Cheers,
Danny.
