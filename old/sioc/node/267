CALL FOR PAPERS
First Workshop on Web Scale Infrastructures for
Semantic Mashup, Search and Retrieval
http://sw.deri.org/2007/05/infrascale/
Co-located with the First IEEE International Conference on
Semantic Computing
September 17-19, 2007
Hyatt Regency Irvine
Irvine, California
Aims and Topic of Interest
The amount of semantically structured data available on the Web has
recently grown considerably. Semantic Web languages such as RDF and OWL
and protocols like SPARQL are finding their way from researchers to
advanced web developers and integrators. Large and important data
collections, e.g. DBLP, Wikipedia, CiteSeer, SwissProt, Geonames, are
now available as retrievable RDF datasets or SPARQL query endpoints.
Popular social networking sites (e.g. LiveJournal, Vox, Tribe, Ecademy)
are producing RDF representation of user interests and acquaintances.
Moreover, there is a clear trend toward embedding more semantic information
in conventional web pages. Microformats are increasing popular, Flickr has
introduced RDF-like &quot;machine tags&quot;, and the W3C is close to finalising RDFa
and GRDDL as recommendations for embedding RDF data into ordinary XHTML
pages. These developments may enable a considerable change in the
availability and significance of semantic data for Web search engines.
While the trend towards publishing data is clearly a prerequisite for the
Semantic Web to take off, benefits from such data availability have not
yet been delivered to the end user.
For developers to efficiently implement applications dealing with such
ata, Web Scale infrastructures for Semantic Mashups, Search and Retrieval
will be needed.
The First Workshop on Web Scale Infrastructures for Semantic Mashup, Search
and Retrieval will be a highly specialised venue to discuss the latest
developments in Web scale infrastructures for semantic data processing.
In detail this workshop will focus on
 * Web scale Semantic Web searching
 * Web crawling for structured and semi structured data
 * Integration of unstructured data into the Semantic Web
 * Entity consolidation and global identification issues
 * Web scale ontology mapping, matching and merging
 * Distributed and Grid algorithms for large scale semantic processing
 * Integrating trust aspects in large distributed semantic architectures
 * Ranking of semantic sources
 * Interaction models for end users and APIs for software clients
Important Dates
 * Paper submission due: June 10, 2007
 * Notification of acceptance: July 1, 2007
 * Camera-ready version due: July 15, 2007
Accepted workshop papers will be included in ICSC proceedings.
Papers will be included in IEEExplore and the index will appear in EI.
