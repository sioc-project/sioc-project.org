  <dc:title>Ontology suggestions needed</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi all -
Thanks for all your recent comments both on and offlist.
A few more ontology suggestions we need your help with.
(1)
We have sioc:topic which can link Sites, Forums, Posts etc. to resources
that are topics of those documents or containers...  (Also,
unfortunately we did not use foaf:topic as the domain is a Document,
which some of the SIOC classes are not).  We can also use dc:subject for
free text.  But what if we want to say that a particular Post describes
a book or is about two books, perhaps something like sioc:about or
sioc:describes is needed.
(2)
We plan to add Category and Tag classes to the sioc:types module to help
with classifying the above sioc:topics for import/export.  Suggestions
welcome.
(3)
We want to add has_part/part_of as subproperties of the corresponding
DCMI terms (hasPart/isPartOf AFAIR).
(4)
I am of the opinion that a Community is NOT a subclass of Space.  A
Space is where data resides, but a community extends beyond mere data.
(5)
We still need a way to recommend to people looking at the SIOC Types
module what kind of vocabularies can be used for Items contained in
particular Container subclasses.  For example, to say that in a
sioct:AddressBook - that you could use JohnsAddressBook (of type
sioct:AddressBook) container_of John (of type foaf:Person or foaf:Agent)
- without having to define millions of subproperties of container_of to
link things, because these are only suggestions (someone may choose to
put something else into their AddressBook).  Ideas needed :-)  This is
related to an idea we had for a Related Ontologies ontology [1].
[1] http://wiki.sioc-project.org/index.php/SuggestedOntologiesOntology
At the moment we&#039;ll just have something like:

    Describes a collection of personal or organisational
addresses.
    
    
    

That seeAlso could be replaced by something more descriptive like...
