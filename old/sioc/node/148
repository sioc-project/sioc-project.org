  <dc:title>SIOC &amp;amp; encoding spatial features.</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hello there,
Uldis introduced me to SIOC and we had some discussions about it. Due
to my geoinformatics background I was thinking a bit about the
possibilities to add geospatial information to
sioc concepts.
The currently most used approach is GeoRSS. OGC (which makes the
standards in our domain)
has published a white paper [1] about it. It is built on top the W3C
geo vocubalary, but extended it to support more complex geometries than
a simple point. It&#039;s big advantage is the upwards compatibility to GML,
which allows for encoding also complex spatial features (take a
collection of bike routes as example). An introduction to GeoRSS and
the model are available at [2].
Let&#039;s take an example of an Event encoded in SIOC. Tagging it with a
location by using GeoRSS could look like this:

        ...
        
         
            45.256 -110.45
         
        

The relationshipTag would be used to clarify the relation between the
sioc element and the associated geometry. A person &quot;lives-in&quot;, a post
&quot;talks-about&quot;, an event &quot;take-place-in&quot; a location. Using tags here is
a neat way to clarify the specific relationship between the used
concept and the location without the need to extend the sioc
vocabulary.
The support of GeoRSS is not too bad, Wordpress and Drupal have both
plugins which make adding locations to posts possible. The SIOC browser
could simply take the location and generate a link to a google map. Or
provide a spatial browser itself which allows to browse through
spatially related posts, for example showing all events which
&quot;takes-place-in&quot; in specific location. How cool would that be? ;)
