  <dc:title>SIOC profile for 'sioc-project.org'</dc:title>
  <dc:description>A SIOC profile describes the structure and contents of a community site (e.g., weblog) in a machine processable form. For more information refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdfs.org/sioc&quot;&gt;SIOC project page&lt;/a&gt;</dc:description>

  <dc:title>SIOC&amp;#039;s pinging service.</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi guys,
I propose to develop, maintain and finance a ping server for SIOC documents. It
would be like weblogs.com but for SIOC documents.
---
- People exporting SIOC documents (weblogs, web services, etc) could ping the
server.
- People importing SIOC documents (crawlers) could fetch the list of newly
updated SIOC documents and then start crawling them.
- I suggest using the XML-RPC and REST API for the communication. That way
weblogs will only have to include the server&#039;s URL into their pinging list to
start pinging it.
---
That way we will have a centralized place where we will be able to fetch SIOC
data for testing/production purposes.
It will be one more tool in the SIOC toolbox (good for promotion)
We could eventually ask to pinging services like Ping-O-Matic to include the
pinging server into a &quot;specialized pinging server section&quot; (also good for
promotion).
----
I would need your thoughts about the project. New ideas, etc.
I would need suggestions for a domain name (pingsioc.com? siocorati.com?).
Once I have that, I&#039;ll start developing it; it could be available by the
beginning of the next week.
Take care,
Salutations,
Fred
