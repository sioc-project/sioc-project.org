  <dc:title>SABRE Conference on SOCIAL SEMANTIC WEB (CSSW 2007)</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>________________________________________________________________________
Call for Papers: SABRE Conference on
        SOCIAL SEMANTIC WEB (CSSW 2007)
        http://aksw.org/cssw
        September 2628th, Leipzig, Germany
________________________________________________________________________
The concept of Social Software was coined to characterize a variety of
software and services on the Web, which enable new ways of communication
and exploit social interactions for creating large content bases from a
multitude of user contributions. The Semantic Web is a extension of the
current Web aiming at enhanced search and navigation facilities and at
integrating information from multiple sources. A question at the moment
actively discussed in conference panels, visionary papers and project
proposals is how the different approaches Social Software and Semantic
Web can be combined in a synergetic way.
CSSW will provide a podium for the rapidly emerging field of approaches
aiming at exploiting Social Software concepts for the bootstrapping of
the Semantic Web and lifting Social Software to the semantic
collaboration level. CSSW aims at combining three different perspectives
on the Social Semantic Web:
* the business and entrepreneurial perspective, focusing on the added
  value of specific social semantic web applications,
* the technical perspective, which enables and supports the exploitation
  of the &quot;ant intelligence&quot; of social networks,
* the social perspective, which explores motivations, benefits and
  emergent effects.
CSSW targets to bring these three perspectives together, to widen
existing horizons, to create novel ideas and to find new ways of
understanding this emerging field.
INVITED TALK
Kingsley Idehen will give an invited talk on &quot;Hello Data Web  Exposing
the Data Web&quot;. Kingsley is Founder, President and CEO of OpenLink
Software, a leading provider of high-performance Universal Data Access,
Data Integration, Hybrid Database Engine technology and developer of the
Virtuoso Server. With his entrepreneurial experience, his contributions
to the technical foundations of the future Web and his backing of the
Open Data initiatives he ideally combines the different perspectives on
the Social Semantic Web.
TOPICS OF INTEREST
CSSW covers all topics related to Social Semantic Collaboration (SSC) in
Web based environments. Typical topics of interest include (but are not
limited to):
Economic / Entrepreneurial Perspective
 * Business aspects of SSC
 * Economies of attention for semantic collaboration
 * Business models for SSC
 * Models measuring costs/benefits of SSC
 * Authentication, authorization and accounting  policies, charging and
   billing models for social software
 * Experimental use cases in areas of telecommunication, dating,
   recruitment, eTourism, eBusiness, eGovernment, etc.
Technical Perspective
 * Applying Social Software strategies such as tagging, mashups for SSC
 * Semantic Data Web: browsers and end-points
 * Extracting and interlinking semantic content from existing
   information sources, e.g. Wikipedia, MusicBrainz, GeoNames
 * Collaborative, community-driven ontology construction
 * Combining existing ontologies and schemata, social ontology sharing
   and matching techniques
 * Reasoning supporting adaptive semantic collaboration, e.g.
   instance driven learning of Description Logic concepts
 * Storage, inference and caching for scalable SSC
 * Exposing and interconnecting Web-APIs as light-weight
   Semantic Web Services
 * Social Semantic Web and Mobile services
 * User-interface components, template languages supporting SSC
Social Perspective
 * Analysis, visualization, presentation of social networks
 * Approaches combining Social Software &amp;amp; Semantic Web
 * Group management, presence, social interaction enablers
   in mobile service platforms
 * Strategies for implementing architectures of semantic participation
 * Trust and privacy issues in social software
 * Implementation of gratification and reward systems
 * Quality analysis of socially generated semantic content
 * Analysis of motivations and behavior of social software users
 * Knowledge acquisition and ontology management in SSC
 * Analysis of emergent effects within social software
SUBMISSIONS
Authors are invited to submit original papers of the following types:
 * Research papers  maximum 10 pages
