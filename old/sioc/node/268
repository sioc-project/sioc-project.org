Classes versus Individuals: Fundamental Design Issues for Ontologies
on the Biomedical Semantic Web
We can distinguish two general strategies for knowledge representation
in biomedicine: the linguistic approach (which is focused on
describing term meanings) and the realist ontological approach (which
is focused on describing things in reality itself). The former
approach is increasingly disregarded in favour of the latter, mainly
because the ontological approach is more intuitive and self-
consistent.

What is eHealth?
Everybody talks about e-health these days, but few people have come up
with a clear definition of this comparatively new term. Barely in use
before 1999, this term now seems to serve as a general &quot;buzzword,&quot;
used to characterize not only &quot;Internet medicine&quot;, but also virtually
everything related to computers and medicine. The term was apparently
first used by industry leaders and marketing people rather than
academics. They created and used this term in line with other &quot;e-
words&quot; such as e-commerce, e-business, e-solutions, and so on, in an
attempt to convey the promises, principles, excitement (and hype)
around e-commerce (electronic commerce) to the health arena, and to
give an account of the new possibilities the Internet is opening up to
the area of health care.

10th Intl. Protégé Conference - July 15-18, 2007 - Budapest, Hungary
The 10th International Protégé Conference will take place at the Hotel
Benczúr in Budapest, Hungary from July 15-18, 2007.
The conference brings together researchers developing or using Protégé
methodologies and tools and is the premier forum for discussion about
current and future applications of the Protégé approach.

1st International WORKSHOP on Ontologies and Information Systems for
the Semantic Web (ONISW 2007)
The emergence of the World Wide Web made massive amounts of data
available. Data exists in many scattered electronic data sources (e-
sources) over the Web. Even though some of the data is in well-
organized data sources, interoperability and integration with data
from other sources, semantic coordination and conflict resolution are
required for its full exploitation. Semantic Web enabled applications
can potentially produce better results for semantic integration,
interoperability and search. In particular, ontologies are widely
regarded as the best solution to global information integration and
semantic interoperability.

SemanticMining - a Network of Excellence in the field of Biomedical
Informatics
The objective of the Network of Excellence entitled Semantic
Interoperability and Data Mining in Biomedicine SemanticMining funded
by the European Sixth Framework Programme, is to establish Europe as
the international scientific leader in medical and biomedical
informatics. The long-term goal of the network will be the development
of generic methods and tools supporting the critical tasks of the
field; data mining, knowledge discovery, knowledge representation,
abstraction and indexing of information, semantic-based information
retrieval in a complex and high-dimensional information space, and
knowledge-based adaptive systems for provision of decision support for
dissemination of evidence based medicine.

College of American Pathologists Introduces SNOMED Terminology
Solutions
The College of American Pathologists (CAP) is renaming its SNOMED
International division. The division will now be called SNOMED
Terminology Solutions and follows last week&#039;s announcement regarding
the formation of the International Health Terminology Standards
Development Organisation (IHTSDO) that acquired the intellectual
property rights of SNOMED Clinical Terms® (SNOMED CT®) and its
antecedents from the CAP.

The Derives_From Relation in Biomedical Ontologies
In recent years the use of ontologies for the development of medical
information systems has witnessed an explosive growth. However,
initial attempts to use ontologies to support information management
in biomedicine have focused primarily on the formulation and
definition of terms. In ontologies and terminologies such as the Gene
Ontology, SNOMED the formal treatment of the relations which would
link these terms has been neglected.

An Ontology-Based Methodology for the Migration of Biomedical
Terminologies to EHR
Biomedical terminologies are focused on what is general, Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) on what is particular, and it is commonly
assumed that the step from the one to the other is unproblematic. We
argue that this is not so, and that, if the EHR of the future is to
fulfill its promise, then the foundations of both EHR architectures
and biomedical terminologies need to be reconceived.

Key Issues of Technical Interoperability Solutions in eHealth and the
RIDE Project
One of the key problems in healthcare informatics is the lack of
interoperability among different healthcare information systems.
Interoperability can be investigated in different categories in the
eHealth domain, such as the interoperability of the messages exchanged
between healthcare applications, interoperability of Electronic
Healthcare Records (EHRs), interoperability of patient identifiers,
coding terms, clinical guidelines and healthcare business processes.
