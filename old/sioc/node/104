Ron Kass from BoardTracker [1] recently visited us in DERI to talk
about our work and give a presentation. See John&#039;s post [2] for more
details.

They are interested to use SIOC, but one question needs to be solved
before that - since they are aggregating boards data and displaying
excerpts of posts on their site (giving new URLs) how should their
SIOC data point to the original post?
This question was already introduced by John when he asked about
caching in post #3 in this thread:
http://groups.google.com/group/sioc-dev/browse_frm/thread/89a9b0a1d7be36c5/#
Some of the options are now described on the wiki.
What are your thoughts?
