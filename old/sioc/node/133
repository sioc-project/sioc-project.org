  <dc:title>SIOC Ontology and Specification - Seeking feedback</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>We are preparing a W3C member submission of the SIOC ontology and
specification, and would appreciate your feedback.
DERI Galway is looking for partners to support the W3C member
submisson. If your organisation is interested in supporting it, please
send me an email to uldis.bojars@deri.org and I&#039;ll provide further
details.
This has been discussed among SIOC developers on #sioc
(irc.freenode.net) and provides an opportunity to stabilise the SIOC
ontology, receive feedback from interested parties and spread awareness
of SIOC.
The submission package consists of the SIOC specification (a
description of the ontology) and document describing current
implementation status of SIOC and relations of SIOC with other
standards and ontologies (creation of this document was suggested in
the feedback, we are composing it now).
Planned schedule:
 - partners inform DERI by sending email to Uldis Bojars
(uldis.bojars@deri.org) about intent to participate
 - send feedback to the specification (by September 14)
 - DERI prepares final version of the document package (by September
19)
 - Partners confirm that the final version is acceptable
 - submit to W3C (by September 30)
Feedback phase may be extended or an additional review phase may be
added if necessary. All the feedback may be sent to the SIOC-Dev
mailing list or to me via e-mail. Thanks to all who have already helped
to improve SIOC.
Best,
Uldis
