  <dc:title>SIOC properties cardinality</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi all,
I was thinking about adding cardinality restrictions to some of the
SIOC properties (if so, the ontology will use OWL properties instead
of RDFS one, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s an issue).
It will allow to more precisely mention what we expect from SIOC data
(and also valid this).
The list has been added to OntologieIssues page of the wiki [1] and
here&#039;s a few one to discuss:
* account_of: min = 1; max = 1 .
If an account is shared by more that one foaf:Person, I think it&#039;s
better to use a foaf:Group as range since sioc:account_of has
foaf:Agent for range (not already in the specs, but seems it was
agreed on the list [2])
* avatar: max = 1 ?
A foaf:Person can have many foaf:depiction, but for a give user maybe
one avatar is enough ?
* content: min = max = 1
Only one content for a post (+ the encoded version)
* email: max=1 ?
Only on email per sioc:User ?
Is that needed ?
* email_sha1: same as email
* has_container: min = 1;
If max = 1, can we use sioc:sibling for same posts on other forums ?
* has_creator: no min, as we can have only foaf:maker; no max (i.e.
colaborative pages / wikis)
* has_host: min = 1; max ?
* id: max = 1
Must be unique, as the spec says
* ip_adress: max = 1
Should be unique for a given sioc:Post
* link: max = 1
Only one HTML page for a sioc:Post ?
* name: min = 1 (needed ?); max = 1 (only on name per sioc:User ?)
Best,
Alex.
