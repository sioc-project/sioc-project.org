  <dc:title>SIOC profile for 'sioc-project.org'</dc:title>
  <dc:description>A SIOC profile describes the structure and contents of a community site (e.g., weblog) in a machine processable form. For more information refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdfs.org/sioc&quot;&gt;SIOC project page&lt;/a&gt;</dc:description>

  <dc:title>Code Needed: Drupal, MovableType</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>There are [many] tasks that need to be done in SIOC and would move
applications of SIOC forward, but which nobody is currently working
on.
It would be great if we list them and look at this list - maybe there
is something that you would enjoy doing or can do very easily. This is
in line with the previous email on LazyWeb in SIOC - call it &quot;LazyWeb&quot;
or &quot;Code Needed&quot;.
Here are some of coding tasks that would bring immediage benefit:
(1) SIOC plugin for MovableType
Most of the blogs on PlanetRDF use either WordPress or MovableType.
WordPress users can use the SIOC plugin which we already have (and
which covers most of the information contained within WordPress), but
MovableType has no SIOC support yet.
I am not a Perl hacker and will not be very efficient at creating such
a plugin. Are you?
(2) Improve SIOC export for Drupal
AidanF writes [1] in answer to a question on status of Drupal SIOC plugin [2]:
&quot;The drupal SIOC plugin currently assumes that you are using the blog
module for posting whereas if you are running a single-user site like
yours or mine you are probably using the story module. There are many
ways to use and organize content with Drupal and not all of them are
covered by the current module.&quot;
This shows that there is some way to go before Drupal plugin covers as
much as WordPress&#039;s does. It directly depends on if you are using
Drupal and are willing to experiment with SIOC data they can get out
of it (and improve the plugin according to your needs).

P.S. Could just concentrate on a single platform - WordPress - and
possibly cover the majority of bloggers (a quick survey at BarCamp
showed that most of bloggers there are using WordPress), but that
would be quite a boring world and if sticking to a single platform we
may overlook the full potential of SIOC.
There must be more ideas / wishes that needs to be done, but these are
the most immediate or what have been around for quite some time. If
you are willing / interested to do some of these tasks or want to
propose new tasks, please reply.
