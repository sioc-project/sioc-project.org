  <dc:title>SIOC profile for 'sioc-project.org'</dc:title>
  <dc:description>A SIOC profile describes the structure and contents of a community site (e.g., weblog) in a machine processable form. For more information refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdfs.org/sioc&quot;&gt;SIOC project page&lt;/a&gt;</dc:description>

&gt; any chance I could talk you into adding a &quot;user&quot; property

&gt; (for community building bla). As the software descriptions
&gt; are DOAP-based, it would be great to have such a property
&gt; in the core vocab as well, e.g.
&gt;
&gt; [[

We discussed a similar idea on #sioc IRC channel. I would suggest to
start with the other direction for this relation first - software
which a foaf:Person is using.
A DOAP profile can&#039;t possibly list all users of a software tool or
keep it up-to-date but if information on software used by people is
attached to their FOAF profiles you can always aggregate them and
discover who is using what.
That&#039;d be good use case - to see what tools your friends are using.
As an experiment in this direction Christoph Gorn added a new property
to his FOAF-X vocabulary which would allow to describe this relation
(what software is somebody using). He also added an example
description to his FOAF profile (one this I remember is that he&#039;s
using VIM :), but I don&#039;t see it now.
Christoph, could you tell a bit more about it?
Best,
Uldis
