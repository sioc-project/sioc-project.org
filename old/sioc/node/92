  <dc:title>Wordpress - XML import/export</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/06/12/xml-import-export/
WordPress will let you export the entire blog and comments in an XML
file starting from the next release (2.1).
The XML format is an extended version of RSS 2.0.
(would be interesting to take a look at it).
&quot;The export is mainly useful for moving content between WordPress
blogs that you run, whether it&#039;s moving from your self-hosted blog to
the convienence of WordPress.com or the other direction. It includes
posts, pages, comments, drafts, private posts, categories, and more.
We don&#039;t yet have a plugin that can generate this format for older
version of WP, but it&#039;ll be coming soon and when it&#039;s done we&#039;ll post
about it.&quot;
---
It&#039;s clear that this format does something similar for &quot;bulk&quot; export
of the blog what SIOC exporters do for individual posts (which can
then be crawled together to get a &quot;replica&quot; of the blog in RDF).
I would not expect them to use SIOC (RSS 2.0 seems like a natural
valid in terms of popularity and implementation) or Semantic Web
technologies for the task of moving data from one blog to another.
Yet we have to see if and how we can benefit from this move. One thing
that comes to mind is to have a converter between this WP XML format
and SIOC, at the same time comparing what can be done with one, and
what - with the other. There must be more...
Best,
