  <dc:title>Announcing SKOS Core 2nd Public Working Drafts</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>  W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group 
We are pleased to announce the publication of the following technical reports as
second W3C Public Working Drafts:
  SKOS Core Guide
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-swbp-skos-core-guide-20051102/
  SKOS Core Vocabulary Specification
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-swbp-skos-core-spec-20051102/
For a summary of revisions since first Working Draft publication see:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-swbp-skos-core-spec-20051102/#secchanges
SKOS Core is a simple, flexible and extensible language for expressing in a
machine-understandable form the structure and content of concept schemes such as
thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies,
&#039;folksonomies&#039;, other types of controlled vocabulary, and also concept schemes
embedded in glossaries and terminologies.
For links to tutorials, presentations, development information, version history,
translations, proposals, datasets and more see the SKOS Core home page:
http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core/
The SKOS Core Vocabulary is an application of the Resource Description Framework
(RDF).  Using RDF allows data to be linked to and/or merged with other data. In
practice, this means that distributed sources of data can be meaningfully
composed and integrated.
For more information about RDF and related specifications, see the Semantic Web
Activity home page:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/
The &#039;SKOS Core Guide&#039; is a guide to the recommended usage of the SKOS Core
Vocabulary, for readers who already have a basic understanding of RDF concepts.
The &#039;SKOS Core Vocabulary Specification&#039; gives a reference-style overview of the
SKOS Core Vocabulary, and describes policies for ownership, naming, persistence
and change management.
These reports are second public Working Drafts, and are work in progress.  We
ask at this stage for feedback from anyone with a potential interest in using
these specifications, or with relevant expertise.  Please send comments and
suggestions on these drafts to public-esw-thes@w3.org and begin the subject line
of the message with &#039;comment:&#039;.  If possible, please send comments before 31st
January 2006. 
The Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group is committed to a
public, consensus-driven design environment for SKOS Core, and to this end
conducts all SKOS-related discussion in public, in particular drawing on
feedback from the Semantic Web Interest Group mailing list:
  public-esw-thes@w3.org
This work has benefited greatly from contributions made
by the members of this mailing list, and their feedback, suggestions and
encouragement are gratefully acknowledged.  The public-esw-thes@w3.org mailing
list is open, and anyone is welcome to subscribe or to post messages.  To
subscribe, send an email to public-esw-thes-request@w3.org with the subject line
&#039;subscribe&#039;, or activate the following link:

Yours on behalf of W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group,
