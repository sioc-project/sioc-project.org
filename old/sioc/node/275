  <dc:title>Some questions about SIOC for drupal plugin</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>
&gt; So I&#039;m assuming that my sioc:site is a host of 1 sioc:forum that
&gt; consists of all the stories (sioc:post) at the site. Does anyone see
&gt; any problems with this?
&gt;
&gt;
Nope, looks fine...
&gt; This also ignores content created by the page module. This is static
&gt; content such as about page, contact details etc. Where does this kind
&gt; of content fit into SIOC?
&gt;
&gt;
If it&#039;s commentable content, it could just take the same form as a story...
&gt; What urls to use?
&gt; -----------------------
&gt; Looking at the snippet above the uris aren&#039;t unique. So or example the
&gt; sioc:site and the sioc:forum have the same uri which is the root url
&gt; of my site. I was thinking of just adding #stories to the url for the
&gt; sioc:forum. Any other suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;
Sounds good...
&gt; sioc:content and content:encoded
&gt; --------------------------------------------
&gt; The drupal module currently doesn&#039;t output the content of posts, just
&gt; the title. What should sioc:content contain and content:encoded?
&gt;
&gt;
This must be a bug as content was exposed...
&gt; Drupal has a set of filters that are applied to the raw text in the
&gt; database. So if a user has defined filters for their content they may
&gt; never want the raw content exposed.
&gt;
I think the content:encoded should be HTML, as this will exposed at
least in pages...
