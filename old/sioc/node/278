Subject: [uf-discuss] Proposal: hArgument Microformat
Hi Folks,
Michael Crichton says: &quot;The greatest challenge facing mankind is the
challenge of distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from
propaganda. Perceiving the truth has always been a challenge to
mankind, but in the information age (or as I think of it, the
disinformation age) it takes on a special urgency and importance.&quot; 
One of the keys to distinguishing information from disinformation is to
have a clear understanding of the assumptions an author is making.
Typically, it takes a great deal of effort to distill an author&#039;s
assumptions.  Bring clearly to light the assumptions being made would
go a long way towards facilitating a web of trust.
I propose an hArgument Microformat with two properties:
hArgument
   assumption (repeatable): a statement of what the author assumes to
be true,
       and upon which his/her conclusion follows. [If it can be
demonstrated that
       the assumption is false, then the conclusion is invalid]
   conclusion (repeatable): a statement that derives from the
assumption(s)
Example: below is an example of an argument.  The argument can be
immediately discredited because the assumptions can be shown to be
fallacious:

   Microformats are a disruptive
technology
   Microformats are attempting to supplant XML
       documents with HTML and XHTML documents
   The main benefit of Microformats is that it
       allows graceful degradation
   Microformats go too far.
   It&#039;s almost better to use a more suited
       format in such cases

The advantage of this is that there is no need to &quot;guess&quot; what are the
author&#039;s assumptions.  They are clearly identified.
Use Cases: any web page that tries to convince you of something.  The
examples are endless.
Comments?
/Roger
