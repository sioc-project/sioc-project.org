  <sioc:content>Christoph&#039;s feedback about the WP SIOC exporter with my comments.
Note: SIOC is open source - if you find any bugs, you are also welcome

Hi!
&gt; Hey, thanks for the ping!!
You&#039;re welcome! :)
By the way - it would be cool if we could discuss the plugin online.
In case you are wondering, it is possible to subscribe to google
groups (e.g., SIOC-Dev) with your existing address, w/o signing up for
GMail or GGroups: just e-mail sioc-dev-subscribe@googlegroups.com
&gt; I just installed it and tested it a little bit, sioc autodiscovery
&gt; seems to work, following the links arround I discovered something
&gt; like  I think that &amp;amp; is no good,
&gt; using curl with that url doesnt work :(
I also had to do a bit of research about using &amp;amp; and it turns out
it is necessary. Try to substitute &amp;amp; with &amp;amp; in the RDF file and you will get
instantly broken RDF/XML. XML users/parsers must &quot;decode&quot; these
entities, so if you are copying it out from RDF/XML by hand, so must
you. :)
&gt; rapper (of redland utils) doesnt accept it too and produces parseerrors:
&gt; rapper: Error - URI http://b4mad.net/datenbrei/index.php?
&gt; sioc_type=post&amp;amp;sioc_id=284:22 - XML parser error - Entity &#039;Atilde&#039;
&gt; not defined
I will look into this problem. Basically I know what it is, just have
to look at the code to see how to fix it. The problem is that in XML
(as opposed to HTML) only 4 or 5 basic entities are defined - so
things like &amp;Atilde; which may be present in post body break XML
validity.
P.S. May I forward this to the mailing list as well?
Best,
Uldis
