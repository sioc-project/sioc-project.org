  <dc:title>Call for Proposals: BlogTalk 2008 - The 5th Int&amp;#039;l Conf. on Social Software - Cork, Ireland - 3-4 March 2008</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>BlogTalk 2008
The 5th International Conference on Social Software
Cork, Ireland - 3-4 March 2008
http://blogtalk.net/
= Overview =
Following the international success of previous BlogTalk events in 2003,
2004, 2005 and 2006, the next BlogTalk - to be held in Cork, Ireland on
3-4 March 2008 - is continuing with its focus on social software, while
remaining committed to the diverse cultures, practices and tools of our
emerging networked society. The conference is designed to maintain a
sustainable dialog between developers, innovative academics and scholars
who study social software, practitioners and administrators in corporate
and educational settings, and other general members of the social
software community.
We invite you to submit a proposal for presentation at the BlogTalk 2008
conference. Possible areas include, but are not limited to:
   * Forms and consequences of emerging social software practices
   * Social software in enterprise and educational environments
   * The political impact of social software
   * Applications, prototypes, concepts and standards
= Participants and proposal categories =
Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, audiences will
come from different fields of practice and will have different
professional backgrounds. We strongly encourage proposals to bridge
these cultural differences and to be understandable for all groups
alike. Along those lines, we will offer three different submission
categories:
   * Academic
   * Developer
   * Practitioner
For academics, BlogTalk is an ideal conference for presenting and
exchanging research work from current and future social software
projects at an international level. For developers, the conference is a
great opportunity to fly ideas, visions and prototypes in front of a
distinguished audience of peers, to discuss, to link-up and to learn
(developers may choose to give a practical demonstration rather than a
formal presentation if they so wish). For practitioners, this is a venue
to discuss use cases for social software and to report on any results
you may have with like-minded individuals.
= Submitting your proposals =
Please upload your submission along with some personal information at
the http://www.easychair.org/blogtalk2008/ site. You will receive a
confirmation of the arrival of your submission within three working
days. The submission deadline is November 16th, 2007. The length of the
proposal should be between two and four pages. BlogTalk is a
peer-reviewed conference.
= Timeline and important dates =
Proposal submission deadline: November 16th, 2007
Notification of acceptance or rejection: December 7th, 2007
Paper version due: January 7th, 2008
Presentations and abstracts on website due: February 7th, 2008
