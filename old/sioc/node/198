  <dc:title>Questions re. Feed to SIOC XSLT script</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi,
Sorry - mixed up what should be a URI for sioc:Forum. Was using the
URL of a feed but should use a URL of the blog / web page itself
instead. Fixed now, XSLT is at the same URL [1].
That brings up more questions:
1. What is a sioc:Site in this case and what should be its URI ?
In the case of WordPress SIOC export the sioc:Site gets a URL of the
blog and sioc:Forum gets a synthesized URL. But maybe it should be the
sioc:Forum instead and leave a sioc:Site w/o a URI (or invent one)?
What about sites like LiveJournal? Should a sioc:Site be
http://www.livejournal.com/ ?
2. If an atom:Entry has both atom:id and atom:link which one should
become a URI for sioc:Post?
Most probably it should be the atom:id, but some sites choose
non-resolvable URIs like &quot;urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:02369:31776&quot;
and there are people who say these are a bad thing to have.

&gt; The code to extract feed&#039;s URL from the link rel=&quot;self&quot; element was
&gt; already there ( thanks, Morten! ), just needed to loosen its matching
&gt; rules because it was looking for a link of type &quot;application/atom+xml&quot;
&gt; but there are many feeds that advertise their url as other MIME types
&gt; such as &quot;text/xml&quot;.

&gt; &gt; thanks a lot for making the feed to SIOC XSLT available!  I&#039;ve checked
&gt; &gt; in a version of the feed-sioc.xsl script [1] that generates valid RDF/XML.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One thing: currently, the URL to the feed has to be passed as a parameter
&gt; &gt; to the XSLT.  Is it possible to get that information out of the feed
&gt; &gt; itself?  I don&#039;t have the feed/Forum URL at hand when invoking the script.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Many thanks!
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Andreas.
