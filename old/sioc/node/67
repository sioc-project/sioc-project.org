  <dc:title>Stuctured Blogging and SIOC</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi guys -
Uldis (or anyone else interested!) - maybe can I ask you to send a quick
e-mail to Raju detailing SIOC open source work to date / future?  They
are in the political participation domain.
Sorry Raju, I&#039;ll get back to you myself when back from leave...
Original message from the Structured Blogging list below.
Thanks a million -
John.

Hi John,
I read the article &quot;Towards Semantically-interlinked Online Communities&quot;.
Very interesting. That&#039;s totally the thing we want to do for enabling
distributed online discussion in the area of political participation. Next
week we have a meeting with some experts to discuss the technical concept
for such a system. If you are doing any open source development of the code
we could think about joining forces with you. Some other people in the
mailing list would be interested in that, too.
Best regards,
Raju

&gt; Hi John,
&gt;
&gt; That sounds interesting. We are currently working in Berlin
&gt; on plans for implementing internconnected online discussions
&gt; to realize &quot;distributed conversations&quot;. I&#039;ll take a look at
&gt; your website and check out if we can base any of our
&gt; development on your work. Thanks for the hint.

&gt; &gt; Betreff: [Structuredblogging-discuss] Stuctured Blogging and SIOC
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi all -
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#039;ve just joined the list.  My name is John and I&#039;m a researcher in
&gt; &gt; the area of the Semantic Web at DERI in NUI Galway, Ireland.  In my
&gt; &gt; spare time, I also run a number of blog sites (journals.ie,
&gt; &gt; planet.journals.ie, planet.journals.co.nz).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You may already have heard of our SIOC (Semantically-Interconnected
&gt; &gt; Online Communities) project.
&gt; &gt; Basically, what it is is an open specification for describing
&gt; &gt; communities using online discussion forums or blogs,
&gt; leading to what
&gt; &gt; some may term &quot;distributed conversations&quot;.  At the moment, online
&gt; &gt; communities are islands that are not interlinked, and the SIOC
&gt; &gt; ontology has been proposed to not only link these
&gt; communities but to
&gt; &gt; leverage data in ways that were previously unknown.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A revised version of our SIOC specification has recently been
&gt; &gt; published.
&gt; &gt; It can be used in on its own (having a complete set of terms) or in
&gt; &gt; conjunction with other RDF formats such as RSS 1.0 (and 1.1).  In
&gt; &gt; terms of producing metadata, we&#039;ve started with SIOC exporters for
&gt; &gt; open-source discussion systems such as WordPress, Drupal, and
&gt; &gt; dotClear.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; More info is available from:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://rdfs.org/sioc/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; While there are many (useful) classes and properties in
&gt; SIOC, it can
&gt; &gt; essentially be boiled down to: Users create Posts that are
&gt; contained
&gt; &gt; in Forums that are hosted on Sites, e.g.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    Site -&gt; host_of -&gt; Forum -&gt; container_of -&gt; Post -&gt;
&gt; has_creator -&gt;
&gt; &gt; User
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Posts have reply Posts, and Forums can be parents of other Forums.
&gt; &gt; We&#039;re also considering introducing a term called Community, since a
&gt; &gt; distributed community can consist of several parts of other sites
&gt; &gt; (e.g.
&gt; &gt; a Drupal forum, a Google Group mailing list and a blog may all form
&gt; &gt; part of a single community), and we are beginning to
&gt; develop a browser
&gt; &gt; for exploring SIOC data.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So why is this relevant to Structured Blogging?  Well, SIOC
&gt; metadata
&gt; &gt; is mainly about describing the structure of discussion posts and
&gt; &gt; forums (that may or may not be interconnected), while Structured
&gt; &gt; Blogging complements this by providing more information about the
&gt; &gt; internal content of the post.  I will also be talking about
&gt; this at a
&gt; &gt; tutorial I&#039;m giving at WWW2006 on Friday...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to some interesting discussions on Structured
&gt; &gt; Blogging, and also on how to integrate SB with both SIOC and the
&gt; &gt; WordPress Multiuser system (see
&gt; &gt; http://www.johnbreslin.com/blog/2006/05/17/how-to-make-stuctur
&gt; ed-blogging-popular/
&gt; &gt; for my thought on this).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; John.
