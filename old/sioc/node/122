  <dc:title>Interaction between SIOC browsers and Talk Digger&amp;#039;s SIOC data exporter</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi guys,
Recently I talked with Alex to ask him if he could be interested in making his
SIOC Browser interacting with Talk Digger. In fact, the next version of Talk
Digger, currently in alpha testing, will generate a SIOC document for each
conversation page.
Currently Alex&amp;#8217;s SIOC explorer is crawling and indexing some blogs that
has the
Wordpress (b2Evolution too?) SIOC exporter plugin.
What I suggested him was to let his browser crawl Talk Digger&amp;#8217;s SIOC data
as
well.
A couple of days ago, Uldis received the acceptance of his speech at the
BlogTalk Reloaded conference. Their job (because he is not alone in the boat)
is to merge all the current SIOC browsers into a unique one for the
presentation (at least it is what I understood).
As people know, the idea behind the SIOC ontology is to link online communities
together. So the idea is the present information, in the same environment (a
SIOC browser in the present case), from many different sources/types of
communities.
So what I would suggest is to start thinking about a way to let Talk Digger
ping the SIOC browser when new SIOC data is available from Talk Digger for the
browser.
By example: a new conversation is tracked by Talk Digger. Once it is tracked,
Talk Digger would ping the SIOC browser to let him know that at the URL
&amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221;
there are new SIOC data ready to be crawled. Then the SIOC crawler would crawl
the URL, index the results, and present it into the browser, along with the
other sources of information (blog, forums, IRC chat logs, etc).
At first, I could create a list of links where data could be crawled, and later
we could think about a more automatic/permanent way to let them interact
together. At first I thought about a simple pinging system using XML-RPC (like
all the new search engines pinging systems). But any other methods could work
as well.
So let me know if you could be interested, if it is a good idea, and how/when
it could be done.
Salutations,
Fred
