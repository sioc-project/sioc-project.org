  <dc:title>swaml:previousByDate/nextByDate (was:  Threads?)</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Hi Sergio,
That&#039;s interesting. Mind elaborating why you did this? Or do you have
a link to an explanation?
I&#039;m interested because when using SIOC for IRC logs, we had to figure
out how to order IRC events that come in the same second; we hacked it
by using the millisecond part of dcterms:created to contain a counter,
so that you&#039;d have the event at 12:03:01 followed by the event at
&quot;12:03:01.001&quot; followed by the event at &quot;12:03:01.002&quot;.
Would you consider changing the definition of swaml:previousByDate and
swaml:nextByDate not to be specific to mailing lists?
I&#039;m wondering how it would work if the same message is in more than
one container, though; it seems to me that SIOC allows both modelling
these as two sioc:Posts and modelling them as one, which wouldn&#039;t be
good for previousByDate/nextByDate :-/

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#039;m confused about this: Does this add information beyond what we know
&gt; &gt; through sioc:reply_of? Or is this just an abbreviation of information
&gt; &gt; that sioc:reply_of already gives us?
&gt;
&gt; I thought the same..., that a thread could be composed using
&gt; sioc:has_reply and sioc:reply_of relationships (that is indeed what
&gt; Buxon does). But if we want to give one more a richer description about
&gt; thread, perhaps TDL [1] would be interesting for us.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, in SWAML we had to add two properties [2] to express chronological
&gt; information between sioc:Post&#039;s, but this is another theme.
&gt;
