CALL FOR PAPERS
-------------------------------------------------------
3rd Workshop on Scripting for the Semantic Web
http://www.semanticscripting.org/SFSW2007/
co-located with
4th European Semantic Web Conference
June 6 or 7 2007, Innsbruck, Austria
-------------------------------------------------------
Scripting languages such as PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Perl, JSP
and ActionScript are playing a central role in current development
towards flexible, lightweight web applications following the AJAX and
REST design paradigms. These languages are the tools of a generation
of web programmers who use them to quickly create server and
client-side web applications. Many deployed Semantic Web applications
from the FOAF, RSS/ATOM, blog and wiki communities, as well as many
innovative mashups from the Web 2.0 and Open Data movements are using
scripting languages and it is likely that the process of RDF-izing
existing database-backed websites, wikis, weblogs and CMS will largely
rely on scripting languages.
The workshop aims to bring together developers of the RDF base
infrastructure for scripting languages with practitioners building
applications using these languages. Last years Scripting for the
Semantic Web workshop in Budva, Montenegro focused on giving an
overview about the support for Semantic Web technologies within
scripting languages. The special focus of this year&#039;s workshop is the
role of scripting languages in the process of populating the Web with
linked RDF data as well as to showcase innovative scripting
applications that consume RDF data from the Web. The second focus of
the workshop is to show how Web 2.0 applications and mashups can
benefit from Semantic Web technologies.
The workshop will include a scripting challenge (conducted for the 2nd
time) which will award a prize to the most innovative scripting
application.
INVITED TALK
Danny Ayers will give an invited talk at SFSW07 about &quot;Two Webs!&quot;
TOPICS OF INTEREST
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
Infrastructure
* Semantic Web frameworks and APIs for scripting languages
* RDF repositories and query languages implemented using scripting languages
* Reasoning engines implemented using scripting languages
* Semantic Web publishing and data syndication frameworks
* Approaches to crawling Web data and querying distributed data on the Web
Applications
* Semantic Web applications using scripting languages
* Approaches to RDF-izing existing applications, such as RDFa and GRDDL
* Mashups that provide RDF views on Web 2.0 data sources such as Google,
  Yahoo, Amazon or eBay
* Wikis, weblogs and data syndication systems using RDF
* Approaches (e.g. RDFa, microformats, GRDDL) to RDF-izing existing applications
* Scripting applications for visualizing Web data.
* Semantic Web Mining and Social Network Analysis
* Mashups that demonstrate the novel capabilities of Semantic Web technologies
Conceptual
* Rapid development techniques for the Semantic Web
* Employment of scripting language characteristics for Semantic Web development
* Scalability and benchmarks of Semantic Web scripting applications
Scripting Challenge
The workshop includes a scripting challenge which will award a prize
(an Apple iPod Video or alternatively Euro 200 cash) to the most
innovative small scripting application or mashup. The application must
be implemented using a scripting language and Semantic Web
technologies. It should access, visualize or combine information from
different sources in new unforeseen ways. Authors of Scripting
Challenge submissions are not required to attend the workshop
personally. More information at:
http://semanticscripting.org/SFSW2007/challenge/
