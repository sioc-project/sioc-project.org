  <dc:title>Employing SIOC for Learning purposes (harvesting Learning Objects Metadata)</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>Some time ago, John informed you about my post where I described how
we use SIOC for IKHarvester (Informal Knowledge Harevster).
To get the general idea of how IKHarvester is planned to work (already
works as a prototype system), read my post: http://dobrzanski.net/2007/04/13/ikharvester/
In short, it harvests metadata for online resources which can be
learning material pieces and stores it in informal knowledge
repository (we find blog posts a great source of informal knowledge).
By using Web Services, client applications can retrieve this metadata
or the content of a specific resource.  For IKHarvester at first point
is dedicated to e-Learning services, it delivers harvested data in a
form of Learning Object Manifest (LOM). In the above mentioned post I
described how we map SIOC predicates to LOM attributes.
What we see SIOC exporter lacks is quite poor information about tags.
The only information SIOC provides is SIOC topic, which actually can
be treated as simple keyword (we map it to LOM General.Keyword and
Classification.Keyword). Anyway, a Learning Object manifest should
also define some classification  rules.
The topics are just keywords a user assigns to a post. WordPress
allows to define a hierarchy within posts. For instance, you can
assign a post about Galway to &quot;Galway&quot; categgory which is inside
&quot;Ireland&quot; one. However, SIOC exporter treat them as if they where at
the same level of the hierarchy - just flattens the hierarchy.
Then, what about Technorati tags? I use &quot;Bunny&#039;s Technorati Tags&quot;
plugin for defiing them. In the output RDF there is no information
about it. Does SIOC support any other WordPress plugins for Technorati
tags?
