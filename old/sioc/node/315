  <dc:title>Semantic Web ideas from the DrupalCon Barcelona 2007</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>[1] is a webpage containing ideas about combining Drupal and Semantic
Web. An excerpt follows. Perhaps this is something the SIOC community
is interested to take part in.
&quot; What Drupal already offers:
   Relationship  - need to contact dman and see if he plan to work
more on this topic. If that&#039;s the case, we need to join forces.
   FOAF - not up to date (4.6), walkah plans to work on it in the next months
   SIOC - not up to date (4.7)
   Semantic Search - alpha in Drupal 5 - would be nice to have 1.0
release for Drupal 5/6/7 . 4 should not be supported since it doesn&#039;t
support PHP5 (maybe I&#039;m wrong?) (- hendler) Everything Drupal needs is
there as a proof of concept, but needs API, cleanup, and better
community.
What Drupal needs: a centralized and easy way of storing RDF data to
an optimized storage. An RDF storage abstraction layer would allow to
use any RDF store:
- internal RDF store implemented into Drupal database (semantic search
has this via ARC)
- external RDF store such as Yars,Sesame, Jena, Virtuoso etc. for
better performance and scalability (semantic search has this with
Sesame and others - see quick UML diagram here.)&quot;
