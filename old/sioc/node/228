  <dc:title>Applying SIOC ontology for Social Semantic Information Spaces (SSIS)</dc:title>
  <sioc:content>I must face the following problem: how to provide mapping for
information that can be harvested in SSIS (blogs, wikis, social
semantic digital libraries, semantic chats, videos available at
youtube, google video etc).
There&#039;s no doubt SIOC suits perfectly for blogs and forums ;) I know
that there are some ideas to apply it to the other, abovementioned,
SSIS. Then it would be perfect for my project.
Recently, I had a talk to Uldis, the SIOC developer on how to apply it
for communicators like Skype. We had some ideas which I want to
share..
Yet, I can use sioc:Post for each message sent during a conversetion
and use some properties to dinstinguish them from post or forum
entries. However, to clarify, some class like sioc:InstatntMessage
could be also intruduced. What do you think about that? Is that needed/
necessary?
Then, regarding real conversatinon: it might be quite long and chaotic
- there is a lot of messages which don&#039;t carry important information.
I reckon I should filter that. How?! Keywords? Any ideas?
Finally problem of connecting messages and navigating through them. Do
it forwards (ahs reply) or backwords (is reply to)? I can group more
messages of a user if they weren&#039;t interrupted by the other person.
Then, maybe treat a conversatin like o single forum?
Looking forwards for comments and ideas
